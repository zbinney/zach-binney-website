BRASS, LLC is my consulting arm. I am always more than happy to talk to teams or other organizations at any level about how I or my students can help with research and analytics around sports injuries, athlete health, and sports performance. 

We can also help teams assess how current and new sports technology investments may or may not fit in with their organizational goals.

I am also available for media inquiries. I have extensive print and TV experience - particularly in the pandemic discussing COVID-19's impact on the sports world - and enjoy working with media organizations as an expert on issues in which I have expertise (for example health-related statistical analyses, sports injury issues, and the intersection of COVID and sports).

Some examples of my public work can be found [here](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/author/zach-binney), and Iâ€™ve appeared on or in the New York Times, NBC, CBS, USA Today, HBO Real Sports, PBS Frontline, the Washington Post, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated, among other outlets. My [CV](0322_CV_ZOB.pdf) is here.

I currently [teach](teaching.qmd) statistics (statistical critical thinking and R programming) and conduct research at Oxford College of Emory University. I have past experience consulting for NFL, MLB, NBA, and NCAA Division I teams, as well as sports technology and pharmaceutical companies. I am happy to provide more details and references upon request. 

If you would like to discuss a consulting arrangement or have a media request, please just reach out to me at Zachary [dot] Binney [at] gmail [dot] com or zbinney [at] emory [dot] edu!
