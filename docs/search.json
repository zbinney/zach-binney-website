    "text": "My name is Zach Binney. I joined Emory University’s Oxford College in August 2020 as an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Theory and Methods.\nI’m an Atlanta native, born and raised. I left for four years to earn my undergraduate degree in the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine from the University of Chicago in 2008, but I returned every summer to work as an editor for the CNN Radio network. I then spent 3 years in Washington, D.C. as a healthcare consultant before returning to Atlanta to earn my MPH in epidemiology from Emory in 2013. After a year of research work at the Emory Palliative Care Center he moved back across the quad to earn his PhD in epidemiology at Emory in 2018. His dissertation was on NFL injuries.\nI have taught multiple courses in epidemiologic and statistical methods as well as R programming to students from freshmen undergraduates through PhD students at Emory and Georgia State Universities. Teaching and interacting with students is what gets me out of bed in the morning.\nMy research currently sits at the intersection of sports and public health, focusing on sports injuries and athlete health. I previously worked in palliative and end-of-life care and and collaborated on projects related to infectious and cardiovascular diseases.\nI’m a lifelong NFL and baseball fan, one of the many things I blame my father for. He was also a statistician for the Braves from 1978-1981, which instilled in me a lifelong love of baseball and stats. But I didn’t begin studying sports injuries until 2013 thanks to a fortuitous accident where an NFL team that offered me a freelance analytics position said “Oh, you’re in healthcare, you must know about injuries, right?” I had not even thought about doing that at the time, but it’s an extremely timely and interesting topic! I’ve been doing in-depth work in the field ever since.\nWhat does a sports epidemiologist do? To grossly oversimplify and steal my own words from one of my FO articles, epidemiologists want to do two main things:\n\nDescribe the distribution of diseases (for example, injuries) in a population (for example, football players) and,\nWhen we see differences within populations (for example, variation by position or team or year), ask and analyze why these differences exist.\n\nThat’s what I do, just applied to sports rather than what might be thought of as more “traditional” public health topics.\nI have consulted for sports organizations (including NFL, MLB, NBA, and NCAA Division I teams), pharmaceutical companies, and media groups on statistical and analytical issues. I am also a staff writer at Football Outsiders and enjoy working with journalists to communicate accessibly about epidemiology and statistics to the public.\nFor more, see my CV or on Twitter @binney_z."

    "title": "Is it Really Too Soon to Judge Roberto Aguayo?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I threatened to do this occasionally in my introductory post, but steel yourselves for a football analytics post that has nothing to do with injuries. You have ESPN’s Bill Barnwell and my friend and colleague Daniel Adler to blame for this.\nOn Bill’s December 5th show the two were discussing Roberto Aguayo, the kicker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that the team drafted in the 2nd round this year. Due to his high draft position Aguayo’s struggles – he is currently just 15/22 on field goals in the NFL – have been highly publicized. I’m heavily paraphrasing, but they basically came to the conclusion that it’s obviously far too soon to judge whether Roberto Aguayo is, in fact, a good, bad, or mediocre kicker.\nNow Bill and Daniel are super smart guys, but I wondered if the statistics would bear them out…\nAguayo is currently 15/22 on field goal attempts, making him a 68.2% kicker overall. One (overly) simple way to estimate how good or bad he really is would be to basically treat each of Aguayo’s kicks as a weighted coinflip and see what range of weights (made field goals) could reasonably yield a 68.2% success rate. This is close to what I did with preseason concussion numbers in a previous post.\nHowever, this approach presents a number of problems. First of all, every attempt is not created equal. The most obvious driver of field goal success is distance, so we need to account for that.\nSecond, this approach would put Aguayo in a vacuum and ignore everything we know from NFL history about true kicker success rates. It doesn’t make sense to say a priori that every possible field goal percentage is equally likely. We should find some way to incorporate that prior knowledge.\nThird, it may be naiive – particularly in a case like Aguayo’s – to treat each field goal like an independent coin flip. The poor guy has been pilloried for every single miss…you’ve got to imagine that has some sort of compounding psychological effect making another miss more likely. On the other side, Justin Tucker is feelin’ it this year, so every successful kick might be making his next kicks more likely.\nThe approach I take below corrects for the first two issues. I’ll also explain the likely effects of the third (independence) issue."

    "section": "Bayesian Analysis",
    "text": "Bayesian Analysis\nI took a Bayesian approach to our question of whether it’s too soon to judge Aguayo. To provide a conceptual Bayesian introduction I’m going to shamelessly steal from Nate Silver’s The Signal and the Noise.\n\nThe Cheating Spouse Example\nSay you want to estimate the chance of your partner cheating on you. You probably have some thought about how likely that is right now; in Bayesian terms, this is your “prior.” Fortunately for me, I love my wife (hi Amy!) and my prior for her cheating is extremely low, but not zero because if it were zero this example wouldn’t work.\nBut now let’s say I come home after a hard day at the blog mines and in the bedroom I find a pair of underwear that very clearly aren’t mine. This is some new “data” or “evidence” that I now need to incorporate into how likely it is that my wife is cheating on me.\nI could do that by the following: I take my “prior” probability of my wife cheating on me, multiply it by how much more likely it is for me to find the underwear if my wife is cheating on me than it is to just find the random underwear, and voila! I now have a “posterior” probability for how likely it is my wife is cheating on me given that I found the underwear. This is basically how humans reason, though not quite as explicitly or mathematically. The basic process is illustrated below:\n\n\n\nThe basics behind Bayesian reasoning. Source.\n\n\n\n\nCheating Spouses and Roberty Aguayo\nNow let’s apply this example to Aguayo. I want to estimate Aguayo’s true field goal “skill”. Before this season started I had the past 5 years of NFL data on kicker success rates – this is one reasonable “prior” for Aguayo’s skill.\nAh, but now I have some data (underwear) on how Aguayo has actually done. I can combine this data with our prior for his skill to get a new posterior estimate of Aguayo’s skill!\n\n\nOur Prior\nThe first thing I looked at was the distribution of overall field goal percentages for 53 kickers with 20 or more kicks from 2011 through now. That’s the orange bars in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, first we need to adjust for the fact that Aguayo has actually faced an easier set of kicks than the average kicker. Only 1 of his 22 attempts has come from 50 or more yards away, with 14 of them from under 40. The blue bars are a weighted average of what each of the other 52 kickers’ percentages would have been had they had the same 0-39, 40-49, and 50+ yard distribution as Aguayo’s.\nBy the way, that blue bar over there on the left by his lonesome, 10% lower than anyone else? Sadly, Aguayo. The bad news is…that’s historically bad. The good news is it’s unlikely to continue to be that bad unless he’s in an unbeatable mental funk of some kind.\nThis distribution doesn’t look quite binomial (notice there was no one with an adjusted field goal percent below 65%), so we’re going to use a slightly fancier distribution to describe kicker success percentages: the beta distribution. The beta distribution is useful for a couple reasons.\nFirst, it’s super flexible – by just varying a couple of numbers that define the curve (alpha and beta), you can get a whole lot of different shapes (see the figure on the right). The orange curve looks kinda like what we want, except we want it on the right and not on the left.\nSecond, it’s super easy to incorporate new information to get a posterior distribution. I’ll spare you all the math, but if we take our prior – which it turns out is best defined by alpha = 69.3 and beta = 10.6 – our posterior estimate is also a beta distribution with alpha = 69.3 + 15 Aguayo makes and beta = 10.6 + 7 Aguayo misses so far. Pretty badass, huh?\n\n\n\nThe beta distribution, so much better than the (nonexistent?) alpha distribution.Source.\n\n\n\n\nSo…is Roberto Aguayo Bad or Not?\nHere are our prior and posterior estimates for what Roberto Aguayo’s “true” field goal percentage is on a set of kicks similar to the ones he has attempted so far. Importantly, this is not an estimate of what his field goal percentage will be moving forward because he could make very different kicks! (NOTE: This chart and the numbers below were updated roughly 3 hours after the original post due to a coding error I discovered, but the main thrust of the results is unchanged.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orange line is our prior; this represents our best estimate of Aguayo’s skill on kicks of the type he’s taken before he ever takes a kick in the NFL. The higher the line is, the more likely that the value on the x-axis is his “true” skill.\nThe gray line incorporates the 22 kicks we’ve seen from him in 12 games so far. The blue line is what our estimate of his skill would be if we saw 4 more games of exactly the kind of kicks and makes/misses he’s had so far – I just multiplied the number of kicks so far by 4/3. The yellow line is the gray line, but after 2 full seasons.\nHere are our means and credible intervals (similar to confidence intervals, but with a different interpretation and philosophy) for all distributions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuess Type\n“Best Guess”\n95% Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\nLower\nUpper\n\n\n\nPrior (No Aguayo Kicks)\n87.6%\n78.5%\n\n\nPosterior, Current Aguayo Kicks\n83.4%\n74.8%\n\n\nPosterior, Full Season of Aguayo Kicks\n82.3%\n74.0%\n\n\nPosterior, 2 Full Seasons of Aguayo Kicks\n79.3%\n71.7%\n\n\n\nBasically, before the season started our best guess is on 22 kicks of this type Aguayo would’ve nailed 87.6% of them if he’s basically like the group of kickers we included in our prior (everybody with >20 kicks from 2011-now). Instead, he’s made 68.2% of these kicks – poor kid.\nIf we consider that we’ve only seen 22 of his kicks and have data on 5,653 other kicks since 2011, our best guess for how he does in the future onthese types of kicks is 83.4%. Not as bad as he is now, but that still only puts him better than about 20-25% of NFL kickers. Yikes. Still, there’s a decent chance his skill turns out to be better than that – there’s a 95% chance his true skill on these kicks is between 74.0% and 89.4%. 89.4% would put him in the top fifth or so.\nIf we continue to see this same kind of performance from Aguayo through the rest of the year, our best guess for how he does in the future would drop to 82.3%. After another full season on top of that, 79.3%, with only a small chance that he’s truly even a League-average kicker. This is an example of the “data swamping the prior” – we put progressively more and more weight on what Aguayo actually does as he, well, does more and more of it."

    "section": "Conclusions and Limitations",
    "text": "Conclusions and Limitations\nI don’t yet disagree with Bill and Daniel that it’s too early to tell, but it’s not looking good. The information Aguayo has given us so far already suggests he’s more likely to be a below-average kicker than not, driven especially by how comparably easy his kicks so far have been. On the plus side, though, it’s not likely he continues to be this bad, either. If we see this performance continue through a second season we will pretty much be able to say he’s a bad NFL kicker.\nHowever, our analysis may be unduly cruel to Aguayo for a couple reasons. First, we used the information from all NFL kickers from 2011-2016 to create our prior. Aguayo – drafted in the second round – was supposed to be better than most kickers. If we’d used a prior distribution of just the top 20 or 30% of kickers – which may have been more appropriate – his posteriors would also look better now. Second, Jesus, the guy’s just had a rough year, and our model doesn’t account for the non-independence of his kicks (i.e. the compounding effects of pressure and missing kick after kick). If he can get out of any nasty mental spiral his percentage could increase a lot more than our model anticipates. That would be great! I’m certainly rooting for that.\nOne other limitation worth noting is the prior is only built on kickers who “survived” to make 20 NFL kicks. So we’re not including the possibility that Aguayo is actually bad enough to have never made it this far without having been drafted in the second round – something Bill and Daniel pointed out on the podcast.\nSo our analysis isn’t looking great for Aguayo, but it also represents a pretty pessimistic estimate of his future chances."

    "title": "Good-Faith NFL Player Vaccination Worries, and Honest Responses",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here, then, is my best attempt to engage honestly and openly with these worries as I see them, in football-specific language where I can. This post will be updated over time as I see more and more arguments against vaccination. I've tried to group these worries into a few broad buckets for simplicity.\nAnd for the record, I got vaccinated with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine the second I was able to here in Georgia.\nCONCERN 1: \"We don't know the long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.\"\nANSWER 1: This is basically true, and it's important to acknowledge that! The vaccines have only been tested in humans for about a year, so the knowledge beyond that for these specific vaccines literally doesn't exist in the universe. But I have several counterpoints.\nWe know from decades of vaccine use that long-term vaccine side effects are somewhere between extremely rare and nonexistent. Any vaccine side effects that do occur tend to occur quickly – within minutes, days or weeks, usually – meaning we would have already seen them. And we pretty much haven't. Intense surveillance efforts for vaccine side effects have uncovered some ultra-rare issues, such as blood clots with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But at the risk of repeating myself they are extremely rare and in line with what we've seen with other more established safe vaccines. This is the vaccine surveillance system working exactly as designed.\nA counterargument could be the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines specifically are a new type of technology – mRNA vaccines – that don't have decades of data in humans. It's OK to be a little worried about that, though it's also important to recognize that wild claims like it's a gene therapy that alters your DNA are 100% false. Lots of very smart people believe the likelihood of long-term negative effects from mRNA vaccines are extremely low, however, and I tend to believe them – that's why I got one of the shots myself. But if you're worried about the mRNA vaccines, there's actually an easy solution – don't get one! Get the J&J vaccine instead, which is based on tried and true old adenovirus vector technology. The drawbacks here are the J&J vaccine may be a bit less effective (but still pretty good, and way better than nothing!) as well as a very, very, VERY small (like, completing 5 Hail Marys in a row small) chance of (treatable) blood clots.\nThe other thing you should keep in mind is weighing the chance of long-term vaccine side effects from long-term COVID effects on your heart, lungs, and brain, from even mild cases, which we also don't understand. Some of your fellow players, like Von Miller, took months to get back to feeling like themselves. Others, like Ryquell Armstead, may never. My wife couldn't use mint toothpaste or eat burgers for almost a year because they tasted like literal trash. Don't put yourself in that situation.\nCONCERN 2: \"Vaccinated people still get COVID. I know several guys who already did!\"\nANSWER 2: Also true! But incomplete. Studies have shown your chance of getting infected and your chance of passing the virus along to others like family members or teammates is substantially reduced – a good approximation is by about 2/3 – if you're vaccinated. The chance of severe disease that lands you in the hospital or, God forbid, kills youis basically zeroed out.\nBut the point is, it's all about the percentages. Your chance of getting infected is reduced if you're vaccinated, even if it isn't zero. It's misguided to think the vaccines serve no purpose if they don't work 100%. Finding counterexamples like vaccinated guys you know who got the virus doesn't change that.\nYou understand the idea of risk reduction and percentages. Just think for a minute. You deal with this all the time in football. Some plays are more likely to succeed than others, right? Shovel passes are more likely to be complete than bombs, but they still fall incomplete sometimes. Doesn't change the fact that they're more likely to be complete.\nThis argument is really like saying, \"Why would I throw the ball to Randy Moss? Chad Chuddington III also catches passes sometimes. I saw him catch two just last week.\" Well, yeah, but I'd still rather have Randy than Chad on my team. Wouldn't you?\nIt's the oldest of maxims in football: any given Sunday. Any team can beat any team on any Sunday. But that doesn't mean some teams aren't much much much better than others on average. The Jaguars beat the Colts once last year! But, forgive me, I'd still rather be the Colts than the Jags.\nNothing is guaranteed with the vaccine. But it's all about putting yourself in a better position to stay uninfected.\nCONCERN 3: \"I'm getting tested every day. I'm not putting anyone (in the NFL) at risk – if anything, my vaccinated teammates getting tested less frequently are.\"\nANSWER 3: Also, honestly, somewhat true! But not an argument against getting vaccinated. You don't do \"just enough\" – you do everything you can to help your team win. You want to be the best you can be, not just \"better than that other guy.\" This argument is deflection. Misdirection.\nAdditionally, your chances on any given day of contracting the virus – and of transmitting it to others – are much higher than your vaccinated teammates. They just are. I don't know that I can explain it any more simply than that. You will be more likely than a vaccinated teammate to contract the virus and spread it to others at some point during the season.\nWe can hope the daily testing catches that. But just like the vaccine, it's not a 100% guarantee. The major problem is it still takes time for your daily test to come back, time during which you could indeed be spreading the virus to others. You could also become infectious later during the day and not know it until later the next day.\nSo, yes, your vaccinated teammates are being tested less frequently. But they're also less likely to get the virus and spread it to others than you are.\nI'd still bet on an unvaccinated (or vaccinated but symptomatic!) player being a greater risk for sparking an outbreak than any unvaccinated and asymptomatic player. Daily symptom screens, and always being conscious of when you develop them, is another solid layer of defense.\nCONCERN 4: \"It's my private choice. It's nobody else's business what I do with my body. You do you, and I'll do me.\"\nANSWER 4: Normally I'm sympathetic to this argument. I really am! It's a valid argument to make when your decisions don't negatively affect anybody else.\nFor example, if you want to spend all night at the strip club, be my guest. That's a truly private issue (between you and any partners you have) that's none of my dang business.\nBut with COVID – or any infectious disease – your decisions affect me. That's where it absolutely does become my business. Whether we like it or not, we're all in this together.\nYour \"personal, private decision\" affects me, not just you, because you're making yourself more likely to spread COVID to me if you're unvaccinated. And, as you pointed out above, even if I'm vaccinated I can still get COVID. So it's perfectly reasonable for me to care about what you do.\nThink about making this argument for drunk driving. \"Sir, before you get behind the wheel, can I just ask have you been drinking tonight?\" You don't get to respond \"That's my private choice,\" because if you're drunk you're putting me at risk by getting on the road. The same principle is at play with the vaccines.\nThere's a stronger argument against seatbelt laws – where your choice not to wear a seatbelt more or less just affects you (except through the unnecessary consumption of hospital resources and healthcare dollars) – than there is against mandates for vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective.\nSo I'm sorry, but this argument doesn't hold water when it comes to infectious diseases."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my attempt to search engine optimize the correct answer to a common mistaken statistic people cite from the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA).\nThe NFLPA – and innumerable and innumerate media sources – claim the average NFL career is around 3.5 years. The NFLPA uses this low number to bolster its case for paying players more, since they need to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can. I support NFL players getting more money – and generally the unions over the bosses in all instances – but this number is simply wrong.\nThe simplest explanation for why this is wrong is to think about average (or median) age vs. life expectancy.\nRight now, per the U.S. Census the median age of Americans is about 38 years – meaning half are over 38 and half are under 38. In NFL terms, this translates roughly to the average years of experience of all players at this point in time – which is, in fact, about 3.5 years! This is the statistic the NFLPA trots out.\nBut when we ask how long an NFL player's career is, on average, what we want isn't analogous to the average age of a population – it's more like life expectancy, or how long an American can expect to live on average. For someone born today, we can expect them to live about 77.0 years on average – roughly twice the median age of the U.S. population!\nSo the NFLPA's number of 3.5 years for the average career is wrong because it mixes up the average experience of NFL players at any point in time (average age) with how long an average career is (life expectancy).\nHere is a source for why it is instead 5.5-6 years in case you're curious for more details.\nOK. End statistical rant."

    "text": "First, Consult Your Values\nThe Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) – which you may know better as Roller Derby – has one of the best return to sport plans I’ve seen. They decided to construct their plan around the motto “Lives Before Laces” – they’re an athlete-run organization, and they want to maintain a very low level of risk for their members if and when any leagues return. Consequently, they say one detected case among anybody associated with the league is enough to send everything back to square one and shut it down for a minimum of two weeks. I 100% respect that.\nBut I also think that in larger, well-resourced leagues with regular testing that has a decent chance at cutting off transmission quickly it’s fair to set your threshold above one case because the fact is with the level of virus we have in this country someone in your league is going to turn up sick – whether or not you come back. If you’re a pro league trying to return and you set your threshold at one case, what are you doing? You’ll have to suspend almost immediately, I promise. Don’t bother coming back. Again, not coming back is a totally defensible choice, I’m just saying don’t come back and set such a low threshold."

    "text": "How Many Cases in Your League is Too Many? Well, It Depends.\nThere are two main scenarios to worry about here:\n\nCreating a higher risk environment.\nCreating an outbreak.\n\nLet’s take each in turn.\n\nFirst, how do you know when you have a “higher-risk environment?” Players and staff, particularly in areas with rampant viral spread, can get sick from events in their daily lives that have nothing to do with the league. Epidemiologists love to think in counterfactuals – in simple terms, what is the risk to players and staff if a.) the league returns or b.) it doesn’t. If a.) is higher than b.) you have a higher-risk environment. Good news: a.) is fairly easy to measure if you’re doing regular testing. But b.) is harder – it’s the counterfactual of what would happen if you didn’t return.\nThe best proxy we have for b.) is results from initial tests of players and staff immediately after they return to team facilities because these cases represent infections they overwhelmingly picked up in the community just living their lives.\nFor players, in the first round of testing in both the NHL and NBA about 5% of players tested positive; those positives probably represent infections picked up in about the prior 2 weeks. This is slightly complicated by the fact that some of these players were probably only doing risky things, like playing pickup games, because they knew the league was coming back, so drop that number a little bit. If the NBA or NHL saw <4% of players testing positive in a 2-week period while they were operating, you could argue they should continue as they’re not adding risk above and beyond what the players would’ve been experiencing absent a return. MLB could do similar calculations.\nFor staff, only the NBA has released data, and it’s remarkable – while in the first week (multiple rounds) of testing 7.1% of players tested positive, just 1.1% of staff did. That’s a huge gap! Setting aside the causes of that – I’m guessing it’s players having more daily contacts based on some combination of things they feel they need to do to prepare and optional behavioral choices – that indicates the threshold for creating a “higher-risk environment” for staff is far lower than it is for players. The NBA would need to see <1% of staff testing positive in a 2-week period while they were operating to argue they should continue as they’re not adding risk above and beyond what the staff would’ve been experiencing absent a return.\nThis seems doable – in this case the NBA in their bubble could have a couple positive tests a week and still be doing OK by this standard. But there’s another wrinkle:\nThe Outbreak. What I’m watching for is 3-4 cases on the same team in rapid succession. That suggests spread through a team that isn’t contained and could quickly explode beyond your ability to control even with testing. Even if your league is still well below your 4%-in-two-weeks (or whatever) threshold, the point is you could be poised to rocket above it and need to take immediate action. In this case the team needs to be shut down for 2 weeks and everybody quarantined separately.\nIf I saw 3-4 cases in rapid succession on 2+ teams I’d be worried for the potential of multiple leaguewide outbreaks and at that point advise a total and complete shutdown of the league and individual quarantines for two weeks.\n\nTo be clear: if you ever exceed either of these criteria, you should shut down a team or the whole league."

    "text": "Are Those the Only Reasons Leagues Should Shut Down?\nNo. Let’s revisit the Roller Derby plan for a moment. Perhaps the thing I love most about it is they base whether they can even restart on the situation in the community around them – hospital space has to be plentiful and there have to be <5 new cases per 10,000 population a day, for example. None of the Big 4 leagues or MLS has talked explicitly about their surrounding communities like this. But they should.\nTake the NBA, for example, with the Orlando bubble plan. Cases are spiking there right now. But even if they kept cases entirely out of their bubble, could they continue no matter what? No. If hospitals get overwhelmed, for example, and a player got injured they’d be drawing away desperately needed medical resources. Maybe a more likely scenario is that the test positive percentage continues to rise in Orlando, indicating a severe lack of tests for those who need them. Even if you’re distributing some of the tests you have to the community, how long can the NBA sit in their bubble testing everybody every day while there’s a shortage around them? And what if, as we’re already starting to see in some places, labs are over capacity and have to start prioritizing certain groups like healthcare workers for 1-day results? The NBA – which is partnering with Quest Laboratories – would be left to either jump the line or not get the timely results they need to cut off transmission chains quickly (a 3-5 day turnaround for tests would substantially weaken the safety protocols inside the bubble because it would take longer to identify and isolate cases). The shortage and capacity issues aren’t their fault, but at some point everybody has to sit down and look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves if what they’re doing is still OK. That’s a bit wishy-washy, maybe, but it’s true.\n(Some may argue MLB is in a slightly better position here because they’re conducting tests at their own bespoke lab in Utah, but that lab could still theoretically be re-tasked with helping other overwhelmed labs, so I don’t see that much of a difference.)"

    "text": "Should Leagues Be Drawing Red Lines?\nThe reality is leagues are not drawing strict, objective lines in the sand. It’s understandable, honestly – case numbers in the league, the distribution of those cases, case numbers in the community, test positive percentages, and hospitalizations all matter, so you can’t just set one number for a go-no go. It would be great if you could have an independent group of experts who can synthesize all of that complex information together into a coherent picture and tell you whether you may or may not continue.\nThe sharper among you might say “Hey, that sounds like a local or state public health department, right?” Yes. I love my colleagues in those places and have no criticisms for any of the scientists who work there. Any of them. They’re doing superhuman work the absolute best they can. But I think it’s also fair to be realistic and say I have uneven faith in their ability and willingness to make these sorts of decisions in the current environment.\nHere’s an alternative: in clinical trials we have this thing called a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. This is basically a group of independent medical experts and advocates who regularly monitor a clinical trial and, if they see a lot of what we call “adverse events” (like death, or heart attacks) with a new drug are empowered to stop the trial. Similarly, you could envision an independent committee with veto power over the commissioner for COVID-19 safety. It would be hard – you’d need a solid majority of truly independent experts with no past work or likely future work with the league, they should be paid upfront, and they’d need unilateral power to shut things down whenever they feel like it. But I think this would be the most moral way to do it.\nWhat leagues are doing instead is basically saying “we’ll know it when we see it” and vesting their commissioners with the power to shut things down. Due to the money involved, though, there’s going to be the temptation to push things farther than they should be. I don’t think anyone can reasonably argue with that. So, that’s the downside of not having an objective red line everyone can hold you to or an independent board.\nEditorializing a bit, I’m more comfortable with vesting this power in Adam Silver and the NBA than other leagues. They were the first to suspend play back in March and, for my money, did it when they should have. They’ve also put together a solid bubble-based plan. Commissioner Silver has earned the benefit of the doubt from me."

It’s quite a simple issue, really.\nFirst, you need to be seeing fewer cases among your players and staff than you would have if you hadn’t restarted. Second, shut the team or league down if you see an outbreak (3-4 cases on one or multiple teams in a few day span). Third, ensure you’re not hoarding tests or medical resources that your communities need. Finally, write down and publicize an objective red line or, if you feel the situation is too complex, empower an independent board of experts to make shutdown decisions; leaving commissioners to “know it when they see it” may tempt you to push things too far."

Lately many of these have focused on some natural questions for folks to have: When and how can sports come back?\nThese are really difficult questions, but I’m doing my best to give realistic answers that help people set reasonable expectations. I often focus on various aspects of the problem in different interviews, so I wanted to collect all my thoughts here in one place.\nBefore we get started, you all should know that I am not an infectious disease expert, a virologist, or an immunologist. I’m a PhD-level epidemiologist, but I focus on sports issues. My goal is to serve to bridge the gap between public health and sports. I talk extensively with my infectious disease colleagues to try and make sure everything I’m saying is accurate, but you should take their word over mine should we ever disagree (and if I discover we do, I’ll update this post to their views ASAP).\nOK, here we go."

    "text": "My overarching message to sports fans right now, in case you plan to stop reading soon.\nThe more aggressively we act to beat back Covid-19 now the sooner we can have sports back. For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Galatians 6:7). We can only reap the benefits of having a low number of cases of Covid-19 cases floating around – such as being able to move back towards normality – if we do the work needed to get there. If we skip over the needed work we will pay a very steep cost.\nFurthermore, the harder we work to keep Covid-19 contained once we get sports back – such as with aggressive and widespread testing to quickly identify new cases, isolate them, and trace and quarantine their contacts – the less likely we are to lose them again due to an explosion in new cases. If we don’t keep the pressure on we risk losing any progress we make in the meantime – backsliding to a time like early April when the return of sports seemed unthinkable.\nDo you want sports back? Great, me too. Believe me, there is not an epidemiologist out there who wants sports (especially football) back more than I do. So work with me and listen when I tell you to listen to my infectious disease colleagues and your local public health authorities, because the things they’re telling you to do are the things that will put us on the road back to normality the quickest without allowing mass death.\nIt’s like aggressively tanking to get a whole bunch of draft picks to improve the team versus being just sort of mediocre for years on end. To put things in the most insufferable sports terms possible: Trust the Process.\nWe should still be in the Teardown in many areas right now – it’s deeply painful and unpleasant but necessary to get where we want to be, but the more aggressively we do it the less time we spend in it. The Teardown involves socially distancing to slow the disease’s spread (done-ish) and get the number of new cases down to a point where we can handle them through other less draconian means (not at all done).\nThen we can move into the Rebuild, where things start improving little by little and we start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Leadership in many areas of the U.S. (though notably not a majority of people in polls) and the federal government seem content to try and force us into the Rebuild now. Many experts (myself included) fear most areas should still be in the Teardown, and if we’re right a decision to try and start the Rebuild now could be disastrous. The Rebuild requires the capacity to test a lot of people repeatedly, quickly identify and isolate new cases, and trace and quarantine their contacts before small outbreaks can get beyond our limits to control without shuttering businesses and sheltering in place.\nThen, finally, our goal is a Championship – a vaccine, but that’s late 2021 at best. And we can’t get there without the Teardown and Rebuild. Teardown, Rebuild, Championship. We could get there together.\nWe all have to work together. We’re teammates right now, like it or not. Let’s all stop freelancing, listen to our coaches, and start pulling in the same direction."

    "text": "Alright coach, start me with the bad news. Sports with fans. When can we be cheering in packed stadiums again?\nIt’s very likely we won’t have sports with fans back until we have a Covid-19 vaccine mass-administered, which is most likely going to be at least late 2021.\nThe key thing to understand is that every person you add to a gathering increases the risk of Covid-19 in two ways: it’s another person who could be bringing the infection in; or, even if they’re uninfected, they’re another person who could catch the disease from someone else and spread it to others. The safest you can be is one person alone in a house or apartment because no one can bring the disease to you in that situation, and you can’t get anyone else sick. Two people is more dangerous than one, ten is more dangerous than two, 500 is more dangerous than ten. By the time you get up to 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 fans the danger level really ratchets up. These are the types of situations where you run the risk of having a super-spreading event where a whole lot of people get sick at once and overwhelm the local public health and, eventually, medical systems. If fans are coming in from out of town – for example, for a World Series game – this single sporting event could also seed new outbreaks in areas all across the country that had otherwise been doing a good job containing the epidemic.\nTo be clear, this doesn’t just apply to sports. It’s unlikely we’ll be able to gather safely in the thousands for anything – festivals, conventions, sporting events – until we have a vaccine.\nAlthough Dr. Fauci has noted the possibility of events with fans this year I think it’s important to note he says this is possible when there is “very, very little infection in a community.” What does very, very little mean? I can’t speak for Dr. Fauci, but to me it means a situation like Taiwan – single digit numbers of new cases in a population over 20 million. Most areas of the U.S. aren’t anywhere close to that, nor do I see them being so any time this year given our late and weak response compared to Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, and even Germany. Sure Montana, Alaska, and Hawaii are, but they have a grand total of zero Big 4 pro sports teams, and I don’t hear anyone suggesting relocating leagues there for logistical reasons."

    "text": "What about stadiums only filling to a fraction of their capacity?\nSome people have floated the idea of having fans at games but keeping stadiums at, say, 15-20% capacity so they can keep fans 6 feet apart in the stands. I’m extremely skeptical. How do you keep people apart during entry? Exit? Concessions and beer lines? Bathrooms? Do you really think every fan is going to arrive at their appointed time or, even harder, sit around and leave at the exact assigned time for their row (especially after an emotional ending, positive or negative)?\nIt’s also important to remember that the “6 foot rule” is really a loose guideline. It’s not like if you’re 5’11” away from someone you’re going to catch any infection and if you’re 6’1″ away you’re 100% safe. It’s a continuum where the further away you are the safer you are. It’s also highly context-dependent. We know things like yelling and singing (you’ve never done either of those at a sports event, have you!?) project respiratory droplets farther and increase the risk of Covid-19 transmission. So it doesn’t really make sense to tell people “stay 6 feet away from other people at the grocery store, and also in a raucous stadium.” Maybe people would actually need to be spaced out by 20 feet in a stadium to keep risk low. We don’t know exactly, but my point in bringing this up is to note it’s a lot more complicated than most people are saying.\nSome people and media outlets have interpreted this as me saying all sports are doomed, period, until we have a vaccine. Not so."

    "section": "So what about sports without fans?",
    "text": "So what about sports without fans?\nWe can likely bring sports without fans back substantially earlier simply because that involves far fewer people and thus reduces risks substantially. I don’t want to make a time-based forecast because that’s not the way we should be thinking. It’s not “oh, if we just socially distance for another month we’ll be back where we need to be and can play sports again.” What will determine when we get sports back are conditions on the ground, not time passing.\nBy conditions on the ground I basically mean the number of active cases. If we can slow new cases to a trickle and have few active cases floating around the population with very little community-based person-to-person transmission, that makes it somewhat safer to gather in large numbers. The lower the number of active cases, the larger gatherings we can have at the same level of risk. Because different sports require different numbers of people to pull off there is no single level where we can say “OK, it’s low enough that sports can come back.” Different leagues may also have different plans for returning that each necessitate different conditions to be done safely – more on that below. It’s all a continuum. My overarching message would be to listen to epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, and local public health officials. Only resume any form of sports if they sign off on your particular plan.\nWe also need to have enough Covid-19 diagnostic tests for leagues to aggressively test their athletes, coaches, and support staff, without taking them away from sick people and healthcare workers, or from surveillance programs that need them to support the efforts to identify and isolate cases that are critical to loosening lockdowns more broadly. We also need to be able to divert the medical personnel needed to run an event or season without putting the rest of our healthcare system at risk of being overwhelmed. Diverting tests or medical personnel who are needed to combat the epidemic to support pro sports instead raises serious ethical questions. Unfortunately as of the second week of May testing growth in the U.S. has been slower than hoped but is now around 400K daily tests – a level still well below what’s currently needed in most areas.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease official in the U.S., echoed these same thoughts around case levels and sufficient testing in a New York Times interview where he also noted that if we can’t meet the conditions necessary to guarantee player and public safety then some leagues may not be able to restart at all this season, even without fans.\nIn more injurious sports we also need to make sure hospitals aren’t hotbeds of Covid-19 activity that would either put athletes needing medical attention at high-risk of getting sick or so near to being overwhelmed that athlete injuries would cause undue stress.\nConsidering all these criteria: we aren’t where I’d like us to be yet to even bring fan-free sports back in the U.S. …but I also don’t know that, with states loosening their restrictions and plateauing or rising cases in many areas of the country outside of the northeast, we will be any time soon. Tests will continue to rise and hopefully be close to what some experts say we need (0.9-1 million/day) in the next month or two. But it’s difficult to ask teams and leagues to wait much more than that when we don’t appear to have a nationwide plan to crush case numbers and are content to just keep things where they are, at best. At this point it probably makes sense to be developing plans to bring pro sports back with intense safety restrictions – more than would be required in many other countries that actually brought the virus under control – in the next couple months, barring a new nationwide explosion in cases."

    "text": "What are the different options for bringing fanless sports back?\nQuite a few plans have been issued by leagues in two basic strains. One strain revolves around various degrees of sequestering athletes and other league and support staff in a lower-risk area that both keeps the league safe from the virus circulating in the general population and helps prevent any case that does get in to a league’s protected zone from getting out and sparking a massive spread in the general population. There is a whole continuum of options here, though, with hundreds of choices and customizations you could make to a plan. Each choice has a risk-benefit tradeoff – each thing you do to try and control infection risk has an economic, logistical, and/or psychological cost. Each league will have to settle on what level of risk vs. expense they can tolerate. The most strict and safe of these sequestering plans would be a true “Biodome” approach.\nThere is also a second path that revolves around daily Covid-19 testing; I’ll call these testing plans.\nEither strain also involves ramped-up hygiene and physical distancing protocols where possible to limit the potential for any infections to spread.\nFrom either of these ideal plans, you can get into progressively riskier plans that rely on a “softer” sequestering of league and support personnel and/or less frequent testing."

    "text": "Let’s start with the ideal sequestering plan: a Biodome.\nOkay, buuuuuuuuuu-dy. It’s a fine place to start. What would a true strict Biodome approach look like?\nEveryone critical to the conduct of the sport – athletes, coaches, officials, medical and training staff, key broadcast staff, and others – would have to undergo a period of individual quarantine and Covid-19 testing to ensure they are uninfected before entering the protected virus-free zone (not an actual bubble) we’ll call the Biodome. The “Biodome” would basically be a geographically-clustered area of living quarters, training facilities, and competition areas. Each person would need to be separately quarantined and then initially tested after 5-7 days to give the virus a chance to rear its head in a positive test, then tested again after a full 14 days to ensure they are still negative and will not develop the virus. This quarantine will have to be much stricter than a stay-at-home order and would ideally be done outside of but as close to the protected virus-free zone as possible. The individual and any family they have chosen to quarantine with would have to find somewhere to live, stay there, and avoid all outside human contact with the possible exception of the people administering the Covid-19 tests for two weeks; all deliveries would have to be disinfected. They would then need to be transmitted as quickly and sterilely as possible – such as via a deep-cleaned bus or van with a driver who has been through quarantine and been living in the virus-free zone or who has a high level of Covid-19 antibodies – into the protected virus-free zone. All the support staff – housekeepers and food preparation staff if the league is being housed at hotels, security, bus drivers to transport players from living quarters to training facilities and playing areas – would have to undergo the same process and live alongside the players and other league personnel in the virus-free zone, spending weeks or months away from their families.\nSo just getting someone safely into the Biodome is a multi-week process. It’s not as easy as you show up, get tested, are negative, and get let in. Even setting aside the issue of false negatives from poor tests or collection procedures, it can take several days for a newly-seeded infection to return a positive test – in other words, it’s possible a player who tested negative and was let into the protected virus-free zone would later turn out to be infected, and the system is compromised. Temperature scans are even worse as we know many cases are asymptomatic and even some with symptoms don’t show a high fever.\nOnce everyone is in the zone you have to maintain a strict closed loop. If families aren’t housed in the zone this means everyone from athletes to housekeepers is spending weeks or months away from them. Nobody, not even hotel support staff, enters without going through the strict two-week quarantine and clearance process. Strict security is maintained to stop anybody from sneaking out and returning. If somebody does need to leave, such as to treat an injury or see the birth of their child or visit a dying relative, they have to go through the quarantine and entry process again. All deliveries are disinfected. You should also probably still test regularly to catch any infections that somehow snuck in early…but if you do find one the system is already blown up, frankly.\nMost leagues looking at centralization and sequestering aren’t going full Biodome. Rather they’re going for a softer approach that relaxes some of these guidelines but is still based around centralization and sequestering along with frequent testing. The closest to a full Biodome I’ve seen so far is MLS."

    "title": "Covid-19: How Can Sports Come Back?",
    "section": "What about the ideal testing plan?",
    "text": "What about the ideal testing plan?\nThis plan is quite simple and comes from Dr. Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington. It involves testing each and every player, coach, trainer, and support staff – anyone with any contact with anyone in the league, including people like hotel housekeepers – for Covid-19 every day. The idea would be to catch cases either before or shortly after they become contagious so they only have a low chance of spreading it to anyone else in the league before they can be identified and isolated.\nThe big benefit of this approach is it eliminates the need to set up a truly closed system with pre-entry quarantines and total sequestering of league staff – you’re essentially saying “OK, we know we’re going to have cases just from people’s daily lives, but we’re going to identify them so fast they won’t have a chance to cause an explosive outbreak.” With this plan hygiene and physical distancing protocols – such as minimizing team-wide gatherings and relying on practices between consistent small groups of players – also take on a bigger importance as another layer of security to stop spread.\nThe big drawback is that this requires a whole lot of tests, which can’t take away from society’s broader capacity. If teams make the investment to actually ramp up new testing capacity rather than cannibalizing what currently exists – possibly even building their own labs – they could donate more tests than they use to the surrounding community, minimizing ethical concerns. In the U.S., though, we’re still not to the point we need to be with testing to accomplish this, and it’s not clear when we will be (or why we’re not there yet).\nThe other risk is that it relies on something that’s unclear: the time between when you get infected with Covid-19, when you’re contagious to others, and when you test positive. If there’s a substantial period (say a couple days) between when you become contagious and when you test positive, this plan crumbles. Infectious disease experts like Bergstrom don’t think this is likely, however.\nSome may argue this plan is independent of the number of active cases in the surrounding area, but I disagree. Even if you’re testing everyone every day, more active cases in the population means a higher chance of players or support staff testing positive and needing to be isolated. That’s disruptive to team operations, and if even one of them sparks a transmission chain the team could be forced to shut down for several weeks. So reducing the number of cases in the area(s) where you operate – or relocating to an area with very few active cases, and which you suspect will continue to stay that way – is still a goal even under this plan.\nThis plan may also be made easier by advances in testing technology, such as saliva tests (where you can spit in a cup rather than having a long Q-tip tickle your brain) or antigen tests (which are quicker and cheaper, but also less sensitive than, current diagnostic tests that rely on growing and detecting copies of the virus’s genetic material).\nSo far the Spanish La Liga seems to be the closest to actually executing this plan. They are testing all players, coaches, and other staff involved in individual training sessions each day. They have had 8/2,500 tests turn up positive and immediately isolated those athletes and staffers. It will be very instructive to see if further cases appear on the teams where the positive tests were detected; if not, it could be a good sign for the feasibility of this plan."

    "text": "Under the ideal testing plan could teams play in their home markets?\nPlaying in home markets adds two dimensions of risk. First, you’re at the mercy of local conditions – if even one of 25-30 markets suffers an explosive outbreak one or more teams could lose their ability to practice and play games, which could cause a destructive schedule disruption. To maintain competitive parity your infection control procedures would have to be constantly adapted to the strictest measures of any jurisdiction a team plays or practices in. Some areas may either never allow games to start or abruptly roll that ability back if cases spike; you need a plan for these scenarios. Second, travel, even private charter travel, brings teams in contact – sometimes close prolonged contact, such as on an airplane – with more people who have to be subject to any infection control procedures the league adapts. There’s also the risk that teams from areas with a lot of cases could bring Covid-19 to markets that had otherwise done a good job of controlling the virus. That would be a public health nightmare. Some areas might even institute travel bans from some especially hot areas with very short notice, causing further scheduling difficulties. Imagine there’s an outbreak in Cincinnati and suddenly Illinois Governor Pritzker says the Reds couldn’t travel to play the Cubs or White Sox that weekend.\nSome sort of centralization – to one or a few locations based on divisions or conferences – would reduce these problems substantially. Under the ideal testing plan, “move the family to Vegas for 4-5 months” is probably an easier sell than “leave your family and isolate in a Biodome in Vegas for 4-5 months.” If you have multiple locations (“hubs”) you should rejigger the travel schedule to minimize travel between the hubs – ideally just one trip between hubs for each team."

    "text": "Are there any easier solutions?\nSure. You can always opt for a “softer” approach that loosens any of the “ideal” protocols for the sequestering or testing plans, but that adds extra risk that may or may not be acceptable based on surrounding conditions. You could ignore the pre-Biodome quarantine and clearance process, for example, or sequester league staff but allow hotel staff to stay home with their families. This appears to be similar to what Dr. Anthony Fauci is suggesting for an MLB season later this year; the fact that he foresees conditions allowing this in the coming months should make us all feel more optimistic. Or you could test every two days rather than every day. But these all increase the risk of an explosive Covid-19 outbreak in your league.\n“Softer” plans are easier to justify if you are in an area with lower transmission and fewer active cases. It’s simple math – the risk of an infection in your league is higher if 1% of the nearby community is walking around sick than if 0.01% is. So to maintain the same level of risk in an area with greater transmission you need to take stricter infection prevention steps. Taiwan has opted for a fairly soft approach with reopening its baseball league, as has South Korea, but they can arguably afford to do that because they have acted so aggressively and kept background cases so low.\nIt’s all a risk-benefit continuum."

Every choice we are going to make in allowing people to gather again has a risk and benefit associated with it. The goal, then, is to keep the risk as low as possible, and below an acceptable level, while maximizing benefits. What is an acceptable level of risk? It’s a judgement call, but I would say trust epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, and local public health officials to tell you when a particular plan reaches an acceptable level of risk based on the conditions on the ground."

    "text": "In any of these plans, what happens if a case does get through?\nLeagues should be developing plans in concert with medical and public health officials for what happens if someone in their league – a player, coach, or other support staff – tests positive. What actions you would want to take really depend on your risk tolerance and any physical distancing procedures you’ve been employing. They could range from only quarantining people the player has spent a certain amount of time with (e.g. within 6′ for more than 15 minutes, the CDC definition of “close contact”), to their whole position group, to a whole team, to shutting down the entire league. I can’t say what would be appropriate in any particular case, but you’d want to assume this would happen and have a plan in place.\nI do agree with representatives from the NBA and NFL who have said we can’t plan to suspend the entire league if one person tests positive. If that’s going to be your bar, don’t even bother restarting. It’s going to happen. If you get 3-4 cases on a team, though, that probably indicates an outbreak and you need to shut that team down immediately for two weeks. If that happens on 2-3 teams you likely have a leaguewide issue and need to shut everything down for 2 weeks. The key is to have a plan that spells these guidelines out ahead of time, and stick to them. Be clear with your players and the public so they know just what to expect. You don’t want to be making panicked, arbitrary decisions later."

    "section": "Are there certain sports that can come back sooner?",
    "text": "Are there certain sports that can come back sooner?\nIndividual sports are easier to bring back than team sports simply because there are fewer people involved. All the problems I’ve listed still exist for individual sports but become smaller in scale the fewer people you have to worry about. So sports like golf (which can be played outside with people largely abiding by social distancing), tennis (harder to social distance during matches, but at least it’s outside), and mixed martial arts (MMA) might be some of the easier ones to bring back.\nTeam sports like baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, and motorsports (I’m counting pit crews and engineers as teammates) are harder to bring back simply because there are more people involved. Epidemiologically speaking, it’s easier to keep 75 people safe for a UFC fight than 250 safe for a football game because there’s less of a chance an infected person slips through whatever defenses you’ve established. The baseline risk is just less. (Although it’s worth noting UFC decided they somehow needed nearly 200 people to pull off their fights in Jacksonville, but I don’t think they cut that down to the bone at all – their list of essential people included, for example, an Octagon Girl.)\nThe overall message here is basically the same as outside the sports world. The number of people you can allow to safely gather is directly related to the number of new cases occurring in the general population. So you need stricter containment of the epidemic and a slower trickle of new cases to restart MLB vs. stage a PGA tour event while maintaining the same level of risk for the participants and society at large.\nAnother dimension to think about is the geographic spread of the sport. Leagues or events that pull people from across a region are easier than those pulling people across a whole country, which in turn are easier than those pulling in people from around the globe. This is for two reasons. First is that you have to have infection control protocols in place that match the “hottest” area from which you’re pulling participants or in which you’re trying to operate. As a U.S. example, there are more cases in New York than Nevada right now. If you were pulling players from or trying to play games in New York and Nevada your infection control procedures everywhere would have to be tailored to the situation on the ground in New York. They could be laxer if you were only pulling participants from and playing games in Nevada. The same principle applies if you are pulling participants from just Taiwan versus from Taiwan, Spain, Sweden and Brazil. This is what makes the Olympics an uncommonly dangerous proposition, even next July.\nSecond is that your ability to hold events is dependent on the strictest restrictions across any areas in which you operate. For example, the English Premier League (EPL) would only be subject to UK regulations (though even operating in only one country is no guarantee your league won’t be shut down). Formula 1, however, might only be able to hold races in certain countries – maybe Monaco would allow it but Germany wouldn’t. That adds an extra degree of complexity to any possible return.\nAny travel a sport requires also adds risk and increases the difficulty of a return – those that can be conducted at a handful of nearby locations are less dangerous than those that necessarily involve international travel such as F1."

    "text": "What about college vs. pro sports? Is one harder than another?\nI would say bringing back college sports is probably harder because they take place in the context of a college that has to be operating. If students aren’t back on campus could you really still have a college football season? College sports leaders seem divided on that issue.\nThere’s one idea for college football that’s popped up a couple places that I want to address directly: holding the 2020 college football season in spring 2021. I’m not buying it. Simply put, I don’t see a lot of situations where we have on-campus college in spring 2021 but not fall 2020. In other words, there’s little reason to believe our situation will look better in January 2021, when the spring semester starts, than August 2020. If there’s a seasonal peak it will probably begin in October or November and continue through at least January 2021, leaving us in a worse situation at the start of spring semester than fall. Even if you were planning to start an abbreviated college football season in, say, March 2021, after a seasonal peak, the plan would still seem to hinge on having colleges with students on campus in January unless athletic directors change their opinion about holding sports without on-campus students. If there’s no seasonal peak, things won’t have gotten worse but they also won’t have really improved.\nHopefully we will have ramped up testing to the level we need to contain Covid-19 by July or August, and any improvements after that will be icing on the cake. If not, we have bigger problems than college football. There’s unlikely to be a vaccine by January 2021; the virus will still be here. Maybe we’ll identify a better treatment between these two times, but that’s entirely speculative – it could come earlier, or not at all. For me to buy into this plan somebody would need to identify what concrete improvements they expect between August 2020 and January 2021 that would make it easier to pull off college football in the spring semester, because I don’t see them.\nRather than skipping fall and then coming back in January, the more likely thing to happen to colleges would seem to be that they start fall semester on campus and then have to go home midway through if a seasonal uptick begins. If they’re able to return it would be midway through spring. Just because of calendar quirks the most dangerous times don’t line up cleanly with semester splits, which makes it more difficult to just move sports around.\nIt’s also worth noting that more and more colleges are opting to move their semester calendars up to start in early August and end by Thanksgiving to both hopefully get ahead of a seasonal peak and avoid back-and-forth travel. I have my doubts that sport, especially football, could do that due to the training and logistics involved, but it’s consistent with my thinking here."

    "text": "Aren’t you being a little pessimistic? After all sports are already coming back in some parts of the world, right?\nI think we’re long on hope and somewhat short on examples so far. On the positive side we have already seen fanless baseball return in Taiwan, whose public health officials are allowing gatherings of up to 500. They are reaping the rewards of what they sowed: an early and aggressive response to Covid-19 fueled in part by their experience with SARS in 2003. South Korea, another country that has been pointed to as as an exemplar of Covid-19 response, has restarted fanless baseball and soccer and is even broadcasting 6 baseball games a week to the U.S. These provide genuine reasons for optimism.\nBut looking at the broader context of things that have actually happened so far rather than just aspirational plans, Taiwan and South Korea so far are positive outliers.  Japan, on the other hand, initially appeared to have contained Covid-19 before cases began to spike, including several cases among a single baseball team; while their season was initially set to restart on March 20, that was pushed back and they remain on hiatus. Their experience underscores the dangers of bringing sports back too soon. China, which initially planned to have basketball back by now, has delayed its league until at least July due to ongoing Covid-19 concerns. Germany restarted the Bundesliga in mid-May around a system where players live at home, abide by social distancing guidelines both there and at work, and are “regularly” tested. I have doubts about the wisdom of this plan, however – Germany is still detecting several hundred new cases a day in a country of 83 million, and a first round of testing the first week of May revealed at least 10 active cases in the Bundesliga. One player was also suspended for ignoring social distancing guidelines at a team facility. I’m still holding my breath. The EPL has gotten clearance from the UK government for a plan to finish out the season at 10 neutral sites beginning in June, but some details remain to be worked out; as of May 26, players were engaging in small group workouts at training grounds. Serie A (Italy) has also returned to small group training as that country has relaxed some restrictions. The Italian Sports Minister is expected to make a decision in late May on whether the league can resume this year, but a potential requirement to quarantine an entire team – or even shut down the league – for a single positive test could make completing the season, even if it can be resumed, difficult. La Liga (Spain) has returned to individual practices and is hoping to restart the season in mid-June. 8 players and team personnel have tested positive out of 2,500 tests to date, but plans have not been altered; all players, coaches, and other staff involved in training are receiving daily Covid-19 tests. They appear to be pursuing something close to the ideal testing plan, so I will be very interested to see their experience. France and the Netherlands, meanwhile, have decreed that no sporting events will be held in those countries, even without fans, until September 1, causing the cancellation of those countries’ domestic soccer league seasons. So there’s a lot of hope but few concrete examples of sports returning even in specific areas with better epidemic control so far.\nIn the U.S., progress so far is minimal. The PGA and LPGA are planning to begin holding events without fans in June, which seems aggressive but not impossible given the unique nature of golf (individual, played outdoors, easy to integrate social distancing). Small gimmicky televised golf events for charity have already taken place. Dana White and UFC are holding 3 events in Jacksonville in early May. Their safety plan was a decent start but even as written had substantial holes – including insufficiently-frequent testing – and was just not enough for the situation we face in the U.S. There is also clear evidence that the written protocols were repeatedly violated, with in-Octagon post-fight interviews, Dana White getting close with fighters without a mask, fighters reportedly leaving the hotel to train at outside gyms, and one fighter with a positive case in his family being allowed to “isolate whenever possible” in the host hotel for two days but being let out for a weigh-in and staredown hours before his test came back positive, as did tests on his two cornermen. We will have to wait and see whether those three cases and the protocol lapses in spark any more cases among UFC fighters and personnel. NASCAR is holding 7 races beginning May 17, but their plan is weak and reckless given the number of people involved. The NBA is reopening training facilities for individual workouts in areas without stay-at-home orders. Although they have not announced any concrete plans for a return to play, they appear to be circling around a plan to centralized at the Disney Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando. The NFL has reopened team facilities in areas where that’s allowed at max 50% capacity, with masks and physical distancing, and with the consent of state and local officials. The Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) has announced it’s going with a Biodome approach – a 2-week quarantined tournament starting in late July at a location TBD. I’m very interested to see if they can pull it off. In Major League Soccer (MLS), some players have returned to individual training at team facilities in areas where it’s allowed, and the league appears to be zeroing in on beginning with a sequestered tournament where the entire league would be brought to Disney Wide World of Sports in Orlando. This is probably the plan closest to a true Biodome I’ve seen so far, with pre-travel testing and a quarantine before anyone enters the playing bubble. Some players don’t sound thrilled, however. Major League Baseball (MLB) appears to be focusing on a plan where teams play in home markets and play an adjusted 80ish-game schedule where they only travel regionally (within East, Central, and West divisions). Spring training would begin around June 14. While the plan is extremely detailed, the biggest hole right now is testing frequency. The latest draft only says “multiple times per week,” which could be anywhere from two (insufficient) to six (probably fine) tests per week. Hopefully they can figure out how to do daily testing; if so, this plan is probably okay. That said, I’m skeptical of a plan involving this little centralization in the U.S. for reasons I’ve outlined above; I wonder if MLB would be able to finish uninterrupted. The NHL is looking at a Bio-hub plan with a 24-team playoff in 2 hub cities; they have officially scrapped the rest of their regular season."

    "section": "Could sports come back in some geographic areas (of the U.S.) sooner?",
    "text": "Could sports come back in some geographic areas (of the U.S.) sooner?\nHere I’m mostly referring to youth and amateur sports, as pro sports either have to operate nationally or will centralize in a few areas where things are under control.\nAnyway, yes and no. I’m of two minds on this.\nThere’s no question that we don’t have one Covid-19 epidemic in the U.S. right now. We have a whole bunch of epidemics at different stages. Washington and California acted early and largely tamped down their epidemics before they got out of control. New York got out of control but is currently seeing hospitalizations dropping, which is an encouraging sign. Other areas of the country, particularly in the south and Midwest, are still thought to be on the upswing.\nI also think different levels of social distancing and shelter-in-place orders are necessary for different areas of the U.S. We are unlikely to fully stamp out Covid-19, but if we do things right you will hopefully in the coming months see more localized outbreaks that are quickly contained. So it’s quite possible you could have some areas that have less strict business closures and allow larger gatherings than others, including those of a size that would allow fanless sports to return – as is already happening in Taiwan, for example, thanks to their uncommonly early and aggressive action. Political differences will surely play a role here, too, but I’m just speaking from a public health perspective.\nHowever, a virus does not obey county, city, or state borders. (National borders may be slightly harder for it to cross depending on their porousness and travel restrictions.) A virus’s sole purpose, insofar as it can have one, is to invade your cells to make copies of itself at the fastest rate it can without killing you (but sometimes it does anyway). So if one area of the country is irresponsible in allowing sports back when it shouldn’t, all of us will suffer if the virus then spreads. We all need to be pulling together in this.\nThe reason we needed strict nationwide measures initially is because, due to a slow response and lack of testing, we didn’t have a clear idea where the virus was and wasn’t. We lost it in the damn lights. We’re getting better about knowing who’s sick where, but we still don’t have testing where it needs to be nor have we actually acted harshly enough to reduce the number of cases in most areas. In football terms: playing defense 11-on-11 is hard enough, but we basically let the virus sneak 4 extra WRs onto the field. I don’t care how good your defense is, you can’t stop 9 receivers. So we had to beg the refs to blow the whistle and stop the game until we can get the extra receivers off the field. We’re currently trying to usher them back to the sideline, with mixed success. That’s the situation we’re in right now with trying to both flatten the curve and get to the other side where the number of new cases slows substantially.\nThat’s why we still need fairly broad-based draconian social distancing measures, because they’re the only tool we have to stop the spread at its current stage. If we can get testing ramped up further and beat the current wave back to a manageable number of new infections hopefully our local and state public health departments – with a huge infusion of funding and public cooperation – can keep an eye on things and we can switch to a more proactive and targeted approach that allows us to institute more restrictive measures only in areas where virus activity is more widespread. But I’m increasingly pessimistic about reaching this point. Our prevailing national plan right now seems to be “eh, good enough” because not enough people have died yet. We can’t plan to save our lives.\nI suppose my overall message is, yes, we’re in a situation where having sports is “more OK” in some parts of the U.S. than others. But for this to not cause a new wave of infections every single jurisdiction has to be extremely responsible about what they’re allowing and coordinate with their neighbors to keep infections from spilling over. I’ll leave it to you as to whether you want to bet on that."

    "text": "These are young, elite athletes we’re talking about here. Is there really that much risk here from Covid-19? Why can’t they just play?\nFirst of all, professional sports doesn’t just involve athletes. It involves coaches and officials/referees/umpires, for example – they’re not all young healthy folks. You would also need medical personnel, athletic trainers, some sort of broadcast staff like camera operators, security, and other critical gameday and team facility staff. So you have to think about the risks to all these people, which are likely much higher.\nThere are also the non-fatal long-term outcomes of Covid-19 to consider. Even if someone doesn’t die it’s possible they’ll suffer lingering lung or other organ damage from the disease. These could be career-threatening for some athletes. This is something scientists are still studying since the disease has only been around for a few months, but it’s a possibility worth considering.\nEven if 99.9% of young athletes who get the virus will recover fully with no lasting repercussions, think of it this way. I walk you down to the sideline of a football field and tell you you have to sprint straight across it from one sideline to the other. You can start anywhere you want between the goal lines, but a 3-inch strip is covered in land mines that could kill or maim you. How much would I have to pay you to make that run?"

Let’s take 1.7 million U.S. deaths, the upper end of initial CDC estimates but somewhat below the Imperial College London model’s initial 2.2 million death estimate absent any social distancing.\nLet’s talk about that number. We’re really bad at dealing with big numbers. That is a Super Bowl blown up by terrorists, killing every single person in the building…24 times. It’s 9/11 every day…for 18 months. What freedoms have we given up, what wars have we fought, what blood have we shed, what money have we spent in the interest of stopping one more 9/11? This is 9/11 every day for 18 months.\nSo no, I would prefer it if we didn’t do that."

For sports fans like me and many others it can also be a powerful psychological boon that shows us we’re on the long, slow road back to normality. I think there’s a real argument to be made for bringing televised sports back as soon as possible as long as public health and player and staff safety is kept paramount. The benefits could outweigh the risks.\nThe argument for having fans in the stands is weaker. What’s really the additional benefit there, other than financial for some leagues? There’s some, sure, but I’d wager it’s less than getting televised sports back. And you would have to take on a lot of risk to get that minimal benefit. It’s not worth it in my mind."

Many athletes have found it a lot harder to train while quarantined or under shelter-in-place orders, for example. They need time to spin back up to full speed. For football, for example, taking guys straight out of shelter-in-place and putting them right on the field would probably result in both a bad product and a high risk of injuries. The necessary training and ramp-up periods will vary by sport, and I trust the athletic trainers and medical personnel in those leagues to make those calls. The point is, we can’t OK a plan one day and have games start the next. Players in virtually any sport will need time to get back in game shape.\nThat time might be extended if that training has to be accomplished after they enter a Biodome or other protected virus-free zone, too."

I hope every league has already done this, frankly.\nThey could also potentially start “wargaming” or simulating the risks from different approaches (e.g. Biodome vs. softer sequestering approach) under a range of reasonable assumptions for how quickly the infection spreads (commonly called the reproductive number R_0), current prevalence and incidence and immunity numbers (basically, where we are on the “curve”), and so forth. Every league has a bunch of quantitative analysts; hook ’em up with infectious disease modelers and use ’em.\nLeagues should also be developing specific plans in concert with medical and public health officials for what happens when someone in their league – a player, coach, or other support staff – tests positive. Would you just isolate them and quarantine anyone with whom they’ve had close contact? Quarantine their whole position group? The whole team (what would that mean for scheduling)? The whole league? What if there are 2-3 cases on different teams?\nTeams should also be considering creative plans to limit the potential damage from a single positive test, such as practicing in consistent groups to create smaller “networks” within a team that can be separately quarantined if anyone in that network gets infected. Splitting your best players across these networks would further help limit damage but must be balanced against the downsides of disrupting team chemistry and practice schemes."

Is there anything they can do to make themselves safer?\nLeagues and teams at any level – pro, college, and youth – should be thinking about lower-cost hygiene and physical distancing protocols they can implement to reduce the spread of any infections that appear among their athletes, coaches, or support staff.\nOn the hygiene front there should be easily-accessible hand washing and sanitizer stations, and all equipment should be thoroughly disinfected between practices and games – and perhaps even within games, such as wiping baseballs down every half-inning and delivering them with gloved ballboys to gloved umpires.\nOn the physical distancing front, any steps you can take to reduce the number of people gathering in close proximity will help. If you have fans for youth sports, maybe restrict them to a small number of immediate family or friends per player, remind them to sit and stand apart and don’t intermingle, and discourage the elderly and higher-risk from attending. As noted above, practice in separate sub-groups if possible. Limit time in cramped locker rooms (e.g. give speeches outside) or only allow players in there in shifts. Physical distancing during play is obviously easier in some sports than others but even in those that require close contact you could take steps to reduce risks, such as installing clear face shields in all football helmets.\nYou could also leverage existing networks: youth leagues could be organized within schools or neighborhoods, for example, so any infection only spreads through that single network rather than both the school/neighborhood and a separate youth sports network. Get creative!\nTravel leagues and large tournaments increase risks substantially, and the situation would have to improve dramatically nationwide for me to be comfortable with those returning. Don’t hold them, and don’t let you kids do them. Please.\nHere’s an outstanding article and information clearinghouse summarizing the current state of youth sports and a host of guidelines from many institutions offering concrete advice on when and how to return."

The biggest unknown is what the number of active cases is going to look like in the U.S. moving forward this summer. Will we eventually see a sustained decline thanks in part to warmer weather? Will we stall out at our current plateau of 20-30,000 cases per day? Will relaxation of social distancing measures occur too quickly and recklessly, leading to a spike in cases?\nAnd what will happen with testing? Will we get to the million or so tests a day many experts say we need to safely reopen? Will saliva-based testing expand? If these do happen, when?\nDevelopments on these and other issues, such as treatments (and obviously vaccines) may cause my opinions to shift.

CTE currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy, severely limiting research on the disease. A test for tau in the brains of the living would be a game-changer for CTE research.\nA number of people, however, have been criticizing the paper for not including the right kinds of people. Specifically, while the study looked at ex-football players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and healthy non-players, some seem confused or even suspicious about why it didn’t also include healthy ex-players?

The thing is, before doing this study we have no idea if the scan works!\nThus we need to do the scan in brains where we expect high levels of tau and where we don’t expect high levels of tau and see if the scans’ results line up with what we expect. If they do, we can have some confidence the test might work. It’s not a guarantee – we won’t know unless we run the PET scan and then soon after do autopsies on the same brains – but it’s encouraging. If the results don’t line up with what we expect, it’s back to the drawing board.\nSo did the researchers do this correctly? Yes. They chose two groups: 1. Former football players experiencing cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms; 2. Similarly-aged men without any cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms or history of traumatic brain injuries.\nBased on prior research we would expect the first group to have some of the highest tau levels, and the second group some of the lowest. I would argue maybe they shouldn’t have even age-matched, but honestly it’s probably fine.\nThey ran the tests in these two groups and found, indeed, that the new PET scan did show higher levels of tau in those expected to have higher levels of tau. Far from conclusive, but definitely encouraging."

The “NFL Injury Report” is actually three separate documents:\n\nPractice Reports – these are reports given by teams on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (for teams with Sunday games)2 that lists the practice status of all players with “significant or noteworthy injuries.” This language does give teams some wiggle room on exactly whom they put on their reports. Some teams, but not all (as far as I can tell), even regularly list players (mostly veterans) who just miss a practice for scheduled rest. Each injured player gets one of the following designations each day:\n\nDid Not Participate\nLimited Participation\nFull Participation\n\nYou could previously also have been listed as “Out,” but that was also eliminated in 2016 to avoid confusion with the Game Status Report.\n\n\n\nGame Status Reports – these are reports given by teams on Friday for Sunday games (or Wednesday/Saturday for Thursday/Monday games). They list a projection for how likely an injured player is to play in the team’s upcoming game. Of note, a player listed on the practice report does not have to appear on the game status report if they are certain to play. The game status designations are:\n\nQuestionable\nDoubtful\nOut\n\nAs noted above, through 2015 “Probable” was a fourth option, but the NFL eliminated that this year.\nIn-Game Injury Report – exactly what it sounds like. We won’t waste more time on it here as it’s not pertinent to our questions.\n\nImpact of Change: There were a lot of prognostications about the effects of this change. I was…uncertain. The players previously named as “Probable” could have followed one of two paths: “Questionable” or off the game status report entirely.\nPath 1: The new rule could result in a lot more “Questionable” tags, since the NFL can get a bit investigate-y if a player not on the game status report unexpectedly doesn’t play.\nPath 2: On the other hand, 90% or more of players marked “Probable” in a given week did in fact play in the team’s next game, so maybe they’d fall off the injury report entirely without a “Probable” designation.\nI really wasn’t sure what to expect, and I thought different teams would probably take different tacks. (Unfortunately, I don’t think we have enough data to stratify by teams yet)."

Because we just wanted to focus on the three categories for the game status report, I excluded all Day-to-Day and IR listings from my analysis.\nI also wanted to calculate the percent of players with each designation who were active or inactive in a given week. The NFL has data on inactive players readily available for 2016, but historical inactive data is harder to come by. I settled on scraping the 2015 data from FFToolbox (for example, here). I did not pull data for 2013 or 2014. I know I’m breaking my own rule for not presenting data from only two years, but it will still provide an instructive comparison between the old and new injury reports, and I don’t think we’ve seen a lot of year-to-year variation in the inactive percentages of each designation."

    "text": "Alright, Enough Already! What Happened with the 2016 Injury Reports?\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously the probable bar went to zero in 2016 as the designation was eliminated. In previous years, the total number of probable and questionable player-weeks was 1,706 (2013), 1,592 (2014), and 1,427 (2015). On average, these years saw 1,083 probable and 492 questionable player-weeks. In 2015 there were 970 probable and 457 questionable player-weeks.\nIn 2016, meanwhile, we saw just 805 questionable player-weeks. If we assume we would’ve seen the same data in 2016 as 2015 if “Probable” hadn’t been removed (likely not a perfectly reasonable assumption because of random variation from year to year), it looks like about 30-35% of “Probable” player-weeks went into the “Questionable” category and the remainder fell off the report. Neat.\nAs a sidenote, you might notice that the number of player-weeks on the game status reports shrank each year from 2013-2015, especially 2014-2015. It’s a bit hard to see in this graph, but I’ve also added 95% confidence limits to each category to help give us an idea of whether this is beyond the random year-to-year variation we might expect.4 The biggest decrease was a 12.5% drop in “Probable” designations from 2014-15. This might mark a trend of less reliance on the Probable category before this season, but I’m still inclined to say it’s random variation.\nI was also curious whether there would also be a tendency to push everyone down the game status list (e.g. 2015 questionable becomes 2016 doubtful). Doubtful designations are basically unchanged while Out designations are up somewhat (377, 452, 459, and 493 player-weeks from 2013-2016) but 2016’s numbers are within the confidence intervals for 2014-15. That doesn’t provide much evidence for this kind of trend."

Now it means, on average, you have about a 73% chance of playing each week. That’s a substantial difference. Given the relative numbers of Probable and Questionable designations in the past few seasons, this is just a tick lower than what we’d expect to see if 30-35% of Probables were now Questionable – but that makes sense since many of the Probables who became Questionables were probably “more hurt” Probables (i.e. their risk of missing a game was likely above the overall Probable average).\nRegardless, the Questionable designation was already a tough-to-predict hodgepodge before this year, and it’s only gotten more heterogeneous."

We’ll leave the question of “statistical significance” for the next section (sort of), but for now, just ask yourself: Is that an impressive drop? A meaningful one? I don’t know. I’m less impressed than I was just looking at the 2015-2016 comparison considering there were only 6 fewer concussions in 2016 than 2013. Maybe 71 is within expected random historical variation and not indicative of a sustained or trending drop; maybe it’s an impressive 15% drop from 2012 and 2014-15. I’m not sure (you’ll read that a lot here).\nIf we stratify by concussions in games versus practices, things become a bit more interesting. Let’s start with practice concussions, which actually look substantially lower the last couple of years. Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and safety policy, said “…it is a trend, we think, now after a couple of years that there are fewer concussions in practice.” OK, two sustained years of a 25% reduction in practice concussions is kind of compelling (though calling 29 to 26 from 2015-16 a “drop,” as John Clayton does here, is a stretch).\nThe game numbers are where I would have a problem with interpreting 2016’s preseason concussion figures as a drop. Look at those numbers; 45 concussions in 2016 is a 16% drop from 2015 (54), but it’s basically in line with the numbers from 2012-2014. Is that something to trumpet? Looking at those numbers, I’d say you could at best say that preseason game concussions are basically flat, with 2015 as a high outlier.\nWe can see the historical variation in these numbers, which we should expect a good bit of given, as Miller correctly points out, we’re dealing with a fairly small sample of concussions each preseason.

But I’m going to try and make this very accessible regardless of your math background, so stick around if you want to learn something!\nWe saw 71 concussions in the 2016 preseason, but that number is subject to something called random error that can cause the number of concussions to bounce around from year-to-year, even if the underlying rate of concussion (the thing the NFL has power over) isn’t changing!2 Quantifying how much might we expect these numbers to bounce around year to year can help us figure out whether 6 or 12 or 30 fewer concussions is actually a meaningful drop or not. So let’s get on that.\n\nCoinflips and Concussions\nThe number of concussions we observe in a preseason is what we call a random variable. The statistical definition of this is quite dense, but what it boils to is it’s a number that we observed that could have been another number. Think of it like this. Take a coin out of your pocket. Flip it 10 times. How many heads did you observe? Let’s say you observed 5 heads, the most likely outcome for a fair coin. But you could have observed 6 or 8 or 1 by random chance - you just happened to observe 5. Flip it 10 more times and see if you get a different number of heads. The number of heads in 10 flips is a random variable!\nThe number of concussions we saw in the 2016 preseason can also be described as a random variable. Think of each player in a single game or practice as a coin flip. How many flips did we have in the 2016 preseason? Let’s assume each team has 90 players in each of the first 3 preseason games and 75 in the last one due to roster cutdowns. Then you have ((90*3+75)*32) = 11,040 “player-games” in the preseason. Let’s also assume each team has 6 weeks of 5 practices per week, with the first 5 weeks featuring 90 players and the last week featuring 75 players. Then you have (90*5*5*32)+(75*5*1*32) = 84,000 “player-practices.” Sum these two together, and we get 95,040 “athlete-exposures” (AEs), which is one athlete participating in one game or practice. This is equivalent to 95,040 flips of a coin which, if it comes up heads, means a concussion (thank you, I’m here all week).\nFortunately for us, this is not a “fair” coin, but a coin weighted heavily against coming up heads, as demonstrated by the fact that we only saw 71/95,040 flips come up heads (concussion). In fact, we can infer that the most likely value for the probability of heads on this unfair coin is 71/95,040 = 0.0007. If we flip a coin so weighted 95,040 times, we are most likely to see 71 heads/concussions. But we might have seen 68, or 83, or 129 by simple random chance.\n\n\nBinomial Distribution\nBut exactly how likely are each of these other values? Random variables such as the number of preseason concussions - where you have k “successess” (concussions) in n “trials” (athlete-exposures) - are described by a mathematical function known as the binomial distribution:\n\n\n\nBinomial distribution equation.\n\n\nDon’t get stuck on the equation. It just describes the probability of observing k concussions in n athlete-exposures where p is the proportion of athlete-exposures that result in a concussion (i.e. the probability of heads on our weighted coin). In 2016, our best guess for p is our observed proportion, or 71/95,040 = 0.0007.3 k can range from 0 to n concussions.\nThe probability will be largest for k = 71 and will grow progressively smaller the further away you move on either side. The exact figures are plotted below (with k truncated at 150 because observing more concussions than that is so vanishingly unlikely):\n\n\n\nExpected distribution of concussion numbers due to random chance.\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Interval\nA common way to define a plausible range of values for any quantity is a 95% confidence interval. In our case, we’ll construct an exact binomial 95% confidence interval for the number of preseason concussions.\nTo do this, we need to take the binomial distribution from above and figure out the range of values around our observed value of 71 that sum up to 95% of the total probability. We do this by first finding a “lower bound” for the interval below 71, and then an “upper bound” for the interval above 71. The process is illustrated on the graph above.\nFor the lower bound, we start summing up the probability that we observed 0 concussions, then 1 concussion, then 2 concussions, and up and up and up until we reach a total of 2.5% probability. Why 2.5%? Well, we need 5% total probability outside our interval, so we want 2.5% on the low end and 2.5% on the high end. It turns out we reach 2.5% probability somewhere between 54 and 55 concussions - let’s say 54 to be safe.\nFor the upper bound, we start summing up the probability that we observed 95,040 concussions, then 95,039, then 95,038, and down and down and down until we reach a total of 2.5% probability. It turns out we reach 2.5% probability way down around between 87 and 88 concussions - let’s say 88 to be safe.\nSo, we can say for the 2016 preseason we observed 71 concussions with a 95% confidence interval of 54-88 concussions. One proper interpretation of this is that if the “true” or “mean” number of concussions in the 2016 preseason was 71 (which it might not be because of random error from our finite sample!), then if we repeated the 2016 season a zillion times we would observe between 54 and 88 concussions 95% of the time.4"

    "text": "Conclusions\nTaking into account our confidence intervals and the observed historical variation in concussion numbers, I’m not convinced 83 to 71 is a meaningful drop. There’s a decent shot we just observed a bit of a low outlier year due to random chance without any change in the underlying concussion rate – which is what the NFL can change and what it should be concerned about. However, I’m not totally convinced it’s not a meaningful drop, either! If I saw preseason concussions stay steady or continue to drop in 2017, I’d be more convinced. But even that might not be enough.\nThe regular season numbers offer another instructive tale about the difficulty of figuring out whether there’s a true trend in concussion frequency or not:\n2012: 173 (95% confidence interval: 147-199) 2013: 148 (124-172) 2014: 115 (94-136) 2015: 183 (156-210)\nThe NFL looked like it was on the right track from 2012-2014 with two consecutive large decreases before concussions spiked again in 2015. Was that a real downward trend in 2013-14 or were they (especially 2014) just low outlier years? Was 2015 a high outlier year, or did that spike reflect some new true spike in the underlying concussion rate? It’s so hard to know, and we need to acknowledge that uncertainty rather than just comparing the numbers from two years to see whether they went up or down."

Some of the points football’s “defenders” make have merit – we don’t know about the prevalence of CTE in high school or college players, for example, nor do we have a good handle on how many ex-players will show actual symptoms of CTE and other brain diseases rather than just the brain damage associated with them (although we do know that ex-NFL players die of neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s disease at 3-4 times the rate of the general population)."

    "section": "Girls’ Soccer Has More Concussions, Why is No One Talking About Banning It?",
    "text": "Girls’ Soccer Has More Concussions, Why is No One Talking About Banning It?\nFirst I’ll discuss the argument’s flawed logic and then its flawed statistics.\n\nLogic\nThis is whataboutism at its finest. “Sure this thing is bad, but look at this other bad thing? What about that, huh? What do you have to say about that? Hypocrite.”\nThis is a weak, lazy, bad faith argument deployed strategically, often by powerful people, with the goal of stopping you from doing anything if you can’t fix everything. It is a common tool used, for example, by lobbyists and politicians to distract from their clients or donors who do bad things. It is also used, consciously or unconsciously, by others who use it to try and distract you from one problem by pointing out another. You have to be on the lookout for it constantly as it can seem very persuasive, especially to good people who just want to help.\nIt turns out that in public health and many other fields we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Regulating full-contact football for children does not mean we can’t also recognize and address the fact that concussions are an issue in other sports, too. If anything, doing the former should help the latter, not hinder it.\nImagine another more obviously absurd example from environmental health: “Why is everybody so focused on lead? What about arsenic? That’s poisonous, too.” The people making this argument are hoping that will lead you not to regulate either rather than both.\nBut maybe the people making the argument are really just invested in the brain health of girls’ soccer players. To that, I would ask them: do you support banning girls’ soccer for those younger than high school?\n\n\nStatistics\nLike all good lies, this one has a kernel of truth at its center that is then warped to the point of being unrecognizable.\nThe kernel: In sports played by both boys and girls, reported concussion rates are roughly 50-100% higher for girls. We’re not sure why – is it some sort of physical difference, or are girls just more culturally willing to report brain injuries? But it’s pretty clearly true. Football, however, is played (almost) exclusively by boys so this argument, even if true, is irrelevant.\nConcussions also account for a larger percentage of injuries in girls’ soccer than in football (see, for example, the 2017-18 report on high school sports injuries here, which shows 24.5% of girls’ soccer injuries are concussions vs. only 22.5% of football injuries). That does not, however, mean that there are more concussions in girls’ soccer than football – more on that below.\nThe warping: The above points are twisted in some motivated people’s minds to become that concussion rates are higher in some girls’ sports than football, and thus they are the real public health issue.\nThe truth: Below is a table of the annual number of concussions as well as the rate per 10,000 athlete-exposures (1 athlete participating in a game or practice is 1 athlete-exposure) for various men’s and women’s sports. The data come from two large nationwide sources for youth and college sports: High School Reporting Information Online (2017-18 report) and the NCAA’s Injury Surveillance System (two separate analyses from the 2009-10 to 2013-14 seasons and 2011-12 to 2014-15 seasons). I included data from two NCAA reports because the newer report did not include nationwide estimated concussion counts.\n\n\n\nHigh school and college concussion rates by sport.\n\n\nIn high school, football has by far highest concussion rate at 9.70 per 10,000 AEs; second is girls’ soccer at 6.91 per 10,000 AEs, nearly 30% lower. Because of the number of children who play each sport, football is also responsible for nearly twice as many concussions each year as girls’ soccer (103,830 vs. 59,447).\nIn college, football (6.71-7.50 per 10,000 AEs) is essentially tied for the second-highest concussion rate. Wrestling leads the way (8.90-10.92 per 10,000 AEs). Football’s rates are in line with or a bit below those for men’s (7.40-7.91 per 10,000 AEs) and women’s ice hockey (7.50-7.80 per 10,000 AEs).\nHowever, because more students play football than wrestle, football is responsible for by far the most collegiate sport concussions each year (3,417). Women’s soccer comes in second and is responsible for less than a third of football’s concussions (1,113).\n\n\nSummary:\nFootball is either at (high school) or near (college) the top when it comes to concussion rates. Because of the number of people who play it, football causes far more concussions than any other sport among both high school and college athletes.\nStop using bad stats about girls’ soccer to distract from the concussion problem in football."

    "text": "Turns out, yeah, pretty dangerous, actually.\nAs I’m working on my dissertation literature review I figured I’d put a small piece of it to good use for someone other than my committee. 4 people would normally read this, so I’m really hoping we can double that.\nThere is a wide-ranging belief that the NFL has the highest injury rates of the major North American sports, but by how much? Because game injury rates (rather than injury rates in practices) tend to be easier to calculate (and more available across studies) than those incorporating practices, we’ll focus exclusively on those.\nWe’ll need to introduce one concept to make the analyses below make sense: the idea of an “athlete-exposure” (AE). This is simply defined as 1 athlete participating in a practice or, in the case of this article, a game. Thus a single NFL game where every available player plays in the game would count for 92 athlete exposures – the 46 guys on the active game day roster on each of the two teams. All the injury rates below are presented per 1,000 AEs.\nThe studies compared below all have differences in how exactly injuries are defined (namely how much practice/competition time a player has to miss for something to count as an “injury”) and the years they covered, but in an effort to ensure high-quality data I’ve limited the studies to official league injury surveillance systems wherever possible.\nAmong the “Big 4” North American sports, the NFL has by far the highest game injury rate at 75.4 per 1,000 AEs. This means for every 1,000 players playing in a single game, 75.4 will suffer some sort of injury. So in a single game with 92 AEs, you might expect about 75.4 x 92/1,000 = ~7 injuries.\nCompared to the other Big 4 North American sports, the NFL thus has roughly 4-5 times the in-game injury rate of the NBA, MLB, and NHL.\nWhat about more international sports (MLS statistics weren’t readily available, so soccer goes here, stop complaining)? The NFL also has roughly 4 times the in-game injury rate of soccer and, interestingly, Australian rules football.\nThe only sport that comes close to touching the in-game injury rate of the NFL is rugby. The data are variable, but in general rugby seems to have either a similar or higher injury rate to the NFL. I wanted to look into concussions specifically in the NFL vs. rugby, but I’ve found some conflicting data and I want to do more research on this before saying anything.\nI’ll spare you the gory details of the data sources unless you want to click below the jump, where I’ve included everything you should need to evaluate these on your own if you want!"

    "section": "Gory Details",
    "text": "Gory Details\n\nNFL\nThe best available estimate of overall NFL injuries comes from a 2017 report from Harvard Law School that used NFL Injury Surveillance System (ISS) data. In 2014-15 (the most recent 2 years available for all injuries) there were 3,553 injuries in regular season games and 737 in regular season practices (82.8% of injuries in games). Assuming 92 athlete exposures per game (46-man game-day roster x 2) and 256 games per regular season, this translates to 3,553/(256 x 2 x 92) x 1,000 = 75.4 injuries per 1,000 AEs in games in the NFL. There were 737 injuries in regular season practices over the same time period. If we assume 4 practices per week, 61 athlete exposures per practice (53-man active roster + 8-man practice squad), 32 teams, 17 weeks, and 2 seasons, this translates to 737/(61 x 32 x 17 x 4 x 2) = 2.8 injuries per 1,000 AEs in regular season practices. The combined game and practice regular season injury rate would then be 13.7 per 1,000 AEs.\n\n\nThe Other Big 4: MLB, NBA, NHL\nWhat about the other of the “Big 4” North American sports? For MLB, the Harvard report began with data from MLB’s Healthy Injury and Tracking System (HITS) that showed 2,988 injuries in the 2011-12 seasons across spring training, the regular season, and postseason. Since ~71.7% of those games would have been in the regular season, we can assume 2,142 regular season injuries. Other data reveal 138,085 regular season player-games in 2011-12 , translating to a game injury rate of 15.5 per 1,000 AEs.\nIn the NBA, Drakos et al used data from the NBA Trainers Association database to estimate a rate of 19.1 injuries per 1,000 AEs in regular season games from the 1988-89 through 2004-05 seasons . Due to the age of this data and the fact that it did not come from a modern EMR system, this is likely something of an underestimate of the true NBA injury rate.\nIn the NHL, McKay et al used data from the Athlete Health and Management System (AHMS) to estimate a regular season game injury rate of 15.6 per 1,000 AEs from the 2006-07 to 2011-12 seasons.\n\n\nSoccer\nFor soccer, MLS data is unfortunately limited and old, but better data is available from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). From 2001-2008, Ekstrand et al estimated 27.5 injuries per 1,000 hours of match play. At 90 minutes per game for most players, this translates to approximately 27.5 / 1.5 hours = 18.3 injuries per 1,000 AEs in UEFA games. (More recent data from the 2014 UEFA Report on injuries reported 23.2 injuries per 1,000 hours of match play in 2013-14, translating to 15.5 injuries per 1,000 AEs).\n\n\nAustralian Rules Football\nFor Australian Rules Football, Orchard et al estimated a game injury rate of 25.7 per 1,000 hours from 1997-2000. At 80 minutes per game, this translates to approximately 25.7 / 1.33 hours = 19.7 per 1,000 AEs. Due to its age, this number may also, like the NBA’s, be a substantial underestimate.\n\n\nRugby\nOne study of the highest level of English rugby (Brooks et al) found a game injury rate of 91.4 per 1,000 player-hours from 1,534 injuries in 420 matches from the 2002-03 to 2003-04 seasons . In this league there are 15 players per team with up to 8 replacements; if we assume the maximum played in each game (23 x 2 = 46), this would translate to 1,534 injuries / (420 matches x 46 players per match) = 79.4 injuries per 1,000 AEs in English Premiership rugby games. A systematic review of 15 men’s senior rugby studies found an overall game injury rate of 81 per 1,000 player-hours (95% CI 63-105). If we take the same ratio of AEs to player-hours as in the English Premiership study, this would translate to 70.4 injuries per 1,000 AEs in games (95% CI: 54.7-91.2). Additionally, a comparison of football and club rugby teams at Ohio State University from 2012-2014 found game injury rates of 23.4 per 1,000 AEs for football and 39.6 per 1,000 AEs for club rugby – though this football rate was lower than the 35-40 per 1,000 AEs reported in other college studies. In the end, it seems likely that at similar levels of competition rugby has game injury rates at least similar to, if not higher than, the NFL."

    "text": "The hottest commodity in the sports analytics world right now is player tracking data. It’s called different things in different sports (e.g. “Next Gen Stats” in the NFL), but it all boils down to somehow measuring exactly where every player is on the field/pitch/court in very short intervals (e.g. 10 times per second).\nThese data sets are extremely rich, complex, and big. For example, in a 7-second American football play, you would have 22 players x 10 observations per second x 7 seconds = 1,540 observations of several metrics (at a minimum, X and Y coordinates on the field). Just wrangling this data into analyzable shape is an enormous challenge, but I’m not writing about that today because I’m not an expert in data engineering.\nInstead, let’s say you have a bunch of this data cleaned, imported, and ready to analyze. What to do next can still feel overwhelming. Where do you even start? My goal with this post is to provide a unified, cross-sport list of high-level options for things you could calculate with tracking data based on the work that I’ve seen; I want to make the problem of what to do next less abstract.\nA couple caveats: first, I come at this from a sports science/player performance/injury perspective, rather than from fan engagement or in-game strategy. This is supposed to be a living document (LAST UPDATE: February 12, 2020), and I’m hoping other people will help me flesh out this list with things I’ve missed to make it more comprehensive. But cut me a little slack if I miss something obvious from outside my expertise – we all need diverse teams to do great work. Second, this post is designed to be a list of metrics you could calculate from the data, not questions you can answer with it. Hopefully this list of metrics a.) helps break the logjam of “Oh God where do I start with all this?” and b.) helps suggest interesting questions you could investigate with some of them. Third, there are a virtually infinite number of ways you could combine and tweak all these metrics – if there’s a popular one of these you like that I didn’t specifically include I’m happy to add it to the list, but I wanted to start with the overarching concepts. A detailed, near-infinite list might be useful for some people, but it wasn’t my goal here. Consider this more an attempt at a taxonomy.\n*Deep breath* OK, let’s go."

    "text": "A(n Incomplete) List of Metrics You Could Calculate\nSo you’ve plotted your data. Now what? How can you quantify, and subsequently numerically analyze, what’s going on in the tracking data? Below I’ve tried to categorize, at a high-level, the major metrics I’ve seen people pull from tracking data (which I assume includes, at a minimum, X and Y coordinates for each player and the ball multiple times per second). This list scopes out some rough bounds for what data scientists might call “feature engineering” – a fancy term for defining the variables you want to include, say, a regression model.\n\nPlayer Movements and Movement Patterns:\n\nDistance Traveled – easily calculable using the Pythagorean theorem. Pause for a gasp at the real-world utility of middle & high school geometry! If a is the difference in X coordinates between two consecutive measurements, and b is the difference in Y coordinates between two consecutive measurements, then you can easily calculate the total distance traveled between two consecutive measurements c. Most often you’d sum these distances up to get the total distance a player traveled over some relatively long period of interest (a play, half, game, or season). This could be considered a very crude measure of the (external) “load” on a player – or how hard s/he worked in a given period.\nPlayer Speed – if you’ve calculated the distance d, and you know the time between two measurements (Δt), you can calculate a player’s speed using d/Δt and convert to sensible units depending on your particular application (e.g. meters per second (m/s), miles per hour (mph)). Sub-metrics within player speed could include…\n-Average speed during a period of interest\n-Maximum speed during a period of interest\n\n\n\n\nSource.\n\n\n\nPlayer Distances by Speed – if you know the player’s speed and distance traveled in each interval, you can sum up either the total time or distance a player traveled in specific speed ranges. These speed ranges are broken into categories such as “walking/jogging”, “high-speed running”, “very high-speed running,” and “sprinting” using sport- or even individual-specific thresholds. How these thresholds are determined is beyond the scope of this post. So you could, for example, calculate the amount of time or distance traveled by a player while in a “high-speed running” range (e.g. 9-13 mph) or a “very high-speed running” range (e.g. 13-18 mph) for some time period of interest, such as a game or training session. This provides a somewhat more-refined look at a player’s “load,” since walking a mile (I can do easily) and sprinting a mile (I would die) are very different tasks.\nAccelerations/Decelerations – If a player is (or can be assumed to be) moving in a straight line and you have a player’s speed s at consecutive time points, then his/her acceleration over that period is Δs/Δt, expressed often in meters/second/second (m/s^2) or in G-forces. These forces put a lot of wear-and-tear on player’s bodies and are relevant when tracking their health (how many times have we asked Player X’s knee to endure sharp decelerations this week?) as well as their performance (how fast can Billy Hamilton accelerate to reach 1st base or catch a fly ball?).However, the actual formula for acceleration is based on velocity v, which is a combination of speed and direction.\nThink about sitting in the carnival ride the Scrambler when it’s going at full speed. You feel a force pushing you into the side of the car – that’s an acceleration, and it’s certainly relevant when talking about, for example, the forces players experience on their joints or heads. Calculating this acceleration requires some tricky math I’m not going to get into here (read: I’m not an expert). Some GPS units will give you a readout of a player’s acceleration during each interval between measurements, but if you’re working without that (or even if you are!) you’ll likely want to consult a physicist or biomechanist.\nOnce you have a measure(s) of acceleration or deceleration you’re satisfied with, there are several things you can do with these:\n-Maximum acceleration and/or deceleration during a given period (e.g. a play)\n-Duration spent above a certain acceleration or deceleration threshold\n-Number of distinct times a player exceeds a specific threshold for acceleration or deceleration, where a “distinct event” ends when a player’s acceleration or deceleration drops back below the stated threshold\nDirectional (Movement) Changes – this is related to accelerations and decelerations, but you can use the X and Y coordinates between two consecutive measurements to determine the direction of movement between those time points. You can then compare the direction of movement between two successive pairs of measurements to calculate the angle between the directions the player is moving between those two pairs. The angles could run between -180 and +180 degrees, with negative angles indicating a left turn and positive angles indicating a right turn. The absolute value of this angle would indicate the “sharpness” of the turn. You could turn these directional change angles into any number of metrics.\nA few examples:\n-Maximum directional change in 1-second period\n-Number of directional changes greater than some specified angle in a 1-second period over the course of a game\n-Number of directional changes greater than some specified angle in a 1-second period while traveling above some specified speed over the course of a game\n–“Zig-zag Ratio” – this was a new metric developed by Elijah Hall in the NFL’s 2019 1st and Future contest. It is essentially an overall way to measure how “curvy” a player’s movement was in a specified period. It is simply the ratio the total distance the player traveled and the straight-line distance between the points at the start and end of the time period you’re interested in. The ratio will be higher for “curvier” routes, becoming infinite if you move some but end up back where you started. I haven’t fully thought through the implications of this metric (perhaps multiplying the ratio by the total distance traveled would be better as taking one step forward and half a step back would result in a high “zig-zaggyness” ratio (2.0) but doesn’t represent a lot of work), but it’s an interesting idea some of you might want to play around with.\nOrientation Changes – Instead of using changes in the direction of movement, you could also measure changes in a player’s “orientation” if your tracking data includes such a measure. This could be more relevant than directional changes in measuring some forces on joints – for example, a player could be running in a straight line but shifts his/her hips to look back for a pass in the air. That shifting is theoretically important to take into account when measuring player load and could be combined with actual changes in the direction of movement and accelerations/decelerations to achieve a more complete picture of the forces a player’s body undergoes at any given moment.\nPer the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, orientation is the direction a player is “facing.” But it may not be what you’re thinking. The GPS chips are in a player’s shoulder pads, so their orientation is the direction their shoulders and torso are pointing – not their head (i.e. it doesn’t represent where they’re looking). I would suggest using this metric with caution unless you understand exactly what it represents about the player’s body.\n\nAcute vs. cumulative measures – generally speaking, any of these metrics could be measured over any time period, from a tenth of a second in-game to cumulatively over an entire season or even career. How hard did Derrick Henry decelerate on that run on 2nd & 3 when he got hit vs. how many decelerations >2.5 m/s^2 has he experienced in the last 6 weeks are different metrics built from the same basic measurement. Both acute and cumulative measures are likely valuable dimensions to consider when using tracking data to assess player performance and health.\nWhich is more relevant will vary by question. For example, do I want to know what acute movement led to Player X’s specific knee injury? Or do I want to know what kind of in-game movement patterns are “riskier” for certain injuries? For these, more acute or short-term measures are probably most relevant.\nOr do I want to know what movement “loads” push players into higher-risk zones over the course of a season? There, longer-term cumulative measures are probably most relevant.\n\n\nContextual Strategic Information\n\nDistances Between Players – This is just what it sounds like. You can calculate the distance to the closest (or second-closest) player on an opposing team or on your own team as a crude contextual measure of the quality of a player’s positioning. You can also think of “distances” in terms of time – not how physically far is a defender from me, but how long will it take him/her to reach me with his/her current speed and direction? This could be useful, for example, in predicting the number of yards an NFL running back is likely to gain from any given spot in his run, or measuring how valuable a basketball shot is based on how contested it is.\nUnder this general umbrella you could calculate things (engineer features) like:\n-Distance to closest defender\n-Distance to second-closest defender\n-Distance to closest ally (e.g. blocker in football)\n-Distance to second-closest ally\n-Number of defenders within X distance of ballcarrier or receiver\n-Number of defenders within X time of player’s current (or a future expected) position given current velocities and directions\nAlternatively, you could simply use raw data on each player’s speed and location (and/or their speed and location relative to something else of interest, like a ballcarrier) and feed it into a fancy neural network to predict some aspect of a game you’re interested in (such as the number of yards a running back will gain on a certain play). That is, if I’m understanding their explanation correctly, basically what The Zoo did to win the 2019 NFL Big Data Bowl (#BigDataBowl Mike, you happy?).\nZone of Control – This isn’t a single metric so much as a general set of analyses you can undertake with tracking data that could then be used to address any number of questions. You can start by building “Voronoi diagrams,” which is a fancy math term for a diagram showing which areas of a field/court/pitch are closest to each player. Below is an example for an NFL play, but these are also extremely common in soccer, basketball, and hockey. This is a crude way of looking at who “controls” which areas of the field based on static player positions at a single point in time.\n\n\n\n\nVoronoi diagram for an NFL play. Source.\n\n\nBetter methods involve accounting for each player’s direction and velocity. If you’re a wide receiver sprinting down the field, you “control” very different territories depending on whether a safety who’s 5 yards straight ahead of you is backpedaling or sprinting towards you at full speed, for example. Check out these papers for more details.\n\n\n\nZone of control model accounting for player and opponent speed and direction in the NFL. Source.\n\n\n\nShape Analysis – Player movements over time (a few seconds) form lines or curves that can be broken up and analyzed. How you would break up and analyze these curves is sport-specific and requires a ton of subject matter expertise.\nFor example, in the NFL you might want to look at the shape of a wide receiver’s route over an entire play and then automatically identify and classify those routes for later use by coaches to look at player tendencies.\nIn soccer, you could map passes (ball movements rather than player movements) and then use a clustering algorithm to try and create a taxonomy of the most common passes for various teams.\n\nThat’s it for now. But as I said above, this is a living document. I will regularly add to it as people point things I’ve missed or new ideas catch my eye, and I’ll always change the date of the last update so people know if they should skim for something new."

    "text": "I saw a remarkable stat reported in Pro Football Talk (PFT) this morning: that starting QBs missed only 35 games in 2016, vs. 76/77/59 in 2013-15, respectively. The claim is sourced to Peter King’s MMQB column this morning, but unfortunately I haven’t been able to find a source document for the actual numbers. Per King, the NFL’s Competition Committee views these data as evidence the new QB protection rules are having their intended effect.\nNow that seemed like a huge drop to me. I did some quick calculations – Teddy Bridgewater (16 games) plus Tony Romo (10 games) plus Jay Cutler (11 games) alone gets us to 37 games missed by starting QBs in 2016. That’s already more than the number reported by King.\nEpidemiologists spend a large chunk of our time just counting things. As it turns out, that’s not grade school math. It’s really, really hard, and a correct count relies on counting a.) the right things and b.) doing so in a consistent manner. So I wanted to go into my injury data, sourced from Pro-Football-Reference, and see if I could replicate the numbers reported by King (and, ostensibly, the NFL). Spoiler alert: I couldn’t really."

    "section": "Counting Quarterback Injuries",
    "text": "Counting Quarterback Injuries\nKing’s column says the following about the numbers: “The NFL defines this statistical category as being games missed by the declared starting quarterback of a team. So even though, for example, Cody Kessler did not open 2016 as the starting quarterback, he was knocked out of two games that he started (concussions) and missed a total of four games because of them. Those count on this list.”\nWell, “declared starting quarterback” is a little vague, but it seems clear that you don’t have to be the week 1 starter to count in these stats. I’m missing some information, but I’m going to now define what I think the goal of this statistic is:\nA count of games missed due to injury by a quarterback who, but for their injury, would have started the game that they are counted as missing.\nThis leads me to count both in-season injuries to starters and certain pre-regular-season injuries to major QBs. Consider Tony Romo and Teddy Bridgewater this year.\nRomo: Even though Romo never started a game this year despite being healthy late in the season, it’s pretty clear that he would have been the starter for Dallas after his recovery but for the amazing performance of Dak Prescott, so his games missed due to injury (i.e. the games he was unavailable/inactive for due to his back) should probably be counted.\nBridgewater: He was the clear starter for this year before he suffered a horrifying knee injury in training camp. You’ve got to count him as missing 16 games unless you’re explicitly just counting in-season injuries, which it’s not clear the NFL was."

    "text": "A (Small?) Wrinkle: (Early) Injuries Beget Injuries\nEvery week there have to be 32 starting QBs in the NFL (not counting byes). So consider the Vikings this year: we’re already dinging Bridgewater with 16 missed games, but other Vikings QBs, such as Sam Bradford, were still at risk of missing games due to injury every week. Meanwhile, a team like the Titans that only lost Mariota late in the year didn’t have those added chances for injuries. In epidemiologic terms, the Titans had less “time at risk” for accruing starting QB injuries.\nIn layman’s terms, there’s the potential for a sort of multiplier effect on games missed of big injuries like Bridgewater and Romo, especially when they occur before the season begins. That’s a caveat that we need to consider.\nThe best approach would be to standardize to an injury rate measure that accounts for this fact (e.g. missed games per 100 possible played games), but to maintain equality with the NFL’s simple counts I’m not going to do that here. Ultimately I think such an adjustment would have a relatively small effect, anyway: there are going to be 32 teams x 16 games per team = a minimum of 512 opportunities for a starting QB to get hurt, and we’re talking maybe 30-50 additional exposures from early season-ending injuries in an awful year."

    "text": "My Analysis vs. the NFL’s\nUsing PFR’s team injury report pages (e.g. here), I calculated the number of games missed for starting QBs from 2013-2016. Because definitions are important, here’s my definition of a starting QB:\n“A starting QB is any quarterback who started at least one game in the season for which we’re counting injuries. Likely starters who did not start a game the entire season as a result of their injury (2014: Sam Bradford; 2016: Tony Romo and Teddy Bridgewater) were also included.” This definition has limitations (see below), but here’s what I found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n# Games Missed by Starting QBs – Me\n# Games Missed by Starting QBs – MMQB/NFL\n\n\n\n\n2013\n90\n76\n\n\n2014\n98\n77\n\n\n2015\n89\n59\n\n\n2016\n85\n35\n\n\n\nUsing my definition of a starting QB, we don’t see the dramatic decline reported by MMQB and PFT. Indeed, 2016 in our data is not out of line with any of the previous 3 seasons. (Ed. Note: this post and data was updated on 3/31/2017 to reflect the correction of a coding error that incorrectly listed Alex Smith the TE as Alex Smith the QB. Be careful, kids!). 2014 was the worst season of the last 4, when early major injuries to Sam Bradford, Matt Cassel, Carson Palmer, and Nick Foles ran up the score.\nThat brings up another important point: say we even take the MMQB/NFL data at face value. A couple catastrophic injuries earlier in the season is all it takes to bring those numbers back in line with those from previous years. Imagine if Carr or Mariota’s freak injuries came in week 2 instead of week 16? How would these numbers look? That said, there’s a reasonable case to be made that increased QB safety delays as well as prevents QB injuries, so I don’t think this particular argument undermines the assertion that the QB protection rules are working.\nRegardless, I don’t find this to be particularly compelling evidence for the rules’ effectiveness. For one thing, why would they just really kick in in 2016?\nA far more likely explanation for the MMQB/NFL data are a combination of random chance and some exclusion criteria that conspired to artificially depress this year’s stats. I don’t have access to the raw data, but if I had to guess I’d say the NFL data probably excluded Bridgewater, Romo, and maybe RGIII and Geno Smith? That would drop my figure to 39, close to their figure of 35."

    "text": "Limitations\nMy numbers are substantially higher across-the-board than the NFL’s, though the difference is starker in 2015 and especially 2016. I’m clearly tracking a somewhat different group than the NFL is in this stat, with the largest discrepancies (percentage-wise) in the last two years.\nWho’s tracking the “right” group? To be honest, it’s a thorny issue and I’m not willing to stand here and say my numbers are right and the ones reported in MMQB are wrong. The advantage of my approach is it uses clean, simple criteria that can be evenly applied across years.\nHowever, my numbers clearly include some backups (SEE table below). I couldn’t come up with a satisfactory, consistent criterion for inclusion beyond “started at least one game during the year or was an obvious starter but for a pre-season injury,” so I reluctantly left them in with the exception of a few egregious long-term cases (e.g. Jacoby Brissett in 2016).\nI am convinced that there’s some quirk in how the NFL tracks this stat that makes the 2016 drop look bigger than it is. They likely took a subtler, and perhaps a more judgement-dependent, approach than I did to classifying starting QBs. The advantage is you get to clear out the backups better, but are the criteria applied consistently overall? Do you accidentally catch some guys who should really be considered starters?\nRegardless, there’s just no way that 35-game figure is accurate; it’s too low to pass even the weakest smell test. Something is off there."

I also don’t buy these numbers as strong evidence for the QB protection rules working for the reasons above as well as the unclear timing effect – why would they really kick in this year? That’s not to say they’re not working or I’m against the rules; I don’t know and I’m not, respectively.\nBut I am against extrapolating beyond what the data can tell us, and any differences between years here are more likely the combined effects of random variation and inconsistent counting criteria.\nIn the spirit of complete transparency, below is the table of QBs by year that I used to calculate the above figures. Play around with them! Add and delete players until you get to a group you’re comfortable with. I’m confident it would take quite a bit of torturing to get 35 games missed in 2016 but 70+ in 2013-14.

I’m back with a very exciting post: I’m updating my prior investigation into the effects of the NFL’s decision to remove “Probable” from its injury report this past season, now that we have a full season to see how teams adapted (the original analysis had only weeks 1-8). Let me tell you, it’s been miserable for NFL injury analysts and honestly…probably pretty much fine for everyone else.\nSince my previous two posts lay out all the relevant background, methods, and data sources in detail, we’re gonna skip right to the results update!"

    "text": "So What Happened When the NFL Dumped “Probable?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart is a stacked bar chart of the number of player-weeks on the injury report with each game status from 2013-2016. I’ve also added (exact Poisson) 95% confidence limits to each category to help give us an idea of whether year-to-year changes in counts are beyond what we might expect from random chance – by and large, they’re not.\nObviously the probable bar went to zero in 2016 as the designation was eliminated. In previous years, the total number of probable and questionable player-weeks was 3,767 (2013), 3,571 (2014), and 3,484 (2015). On average, these years saw 2,524 probable and 1,084 questionable player-weeks. In 2015 there were 2,424 probable and 1,060 questionable player-weeks.\nIn 2016, meanwhile, we saw just 1,746 questionable player-weeks. If we assume we would’ve seen the same data in 2016 as 2015 if “Probable” hadn’t been removed (likely not a perfectly reasonable assumption because of random variation from year to year), it looks like about 35-40% of “Probable” player-weeks went into the “Questionable” category and the remainder fell off the report. This is just a touch higher than our mid-season estimate of 30-35%.\nI was also curious whether there would also be a tendency to push everyone down the game status list (e.g. 2015 questionable becomes 2016 doubtful). Doubtful designations are basically unchanged while Out designations are up somewhat (747, 877, 920, and 1,009 player-weeks from 2013-2016), but overall I’m not seeing a ton of evidence for this kind of trend."

Previously the League said 75% of Probable, 50% of Questionable, and 25% of Doubtful players should play, but these percentages – which weren’t all that accurate, anyway, to be fair – are now gone. So what does Questionable mean in 2016?\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out a “Questionable” designation used to mean that, on average, you had about about a 65-70% chance of playing that week, though this varies a lot by team1. In 2016 players had about a 75% chance of playing each week; that’s a substantial difference.\nGiven the relative numbers of Probable and Questionable designations in the past few seasons, this is just a tick lower than what we’d expect to see if 35-40% of Probables were now Questionable – but that makes sense since many of the Probables who became Questionables were probably “more hurt” Probables (i.e. their risk of missing a game was likely above the overall Probable average).\nThese numbers are also largely in line with our mid-season analysis, though the proportion of Questionables playing in 2015 is somewhat higher.\nRegardless, the Questionable designation was already a tough-to-predict hodgepodge before this year, and it’s only gotten more heterogeneous."

    "section": "Projecting Questionable Players in the Post-Probable Era",
    "text": "Projecting Questionable Players in the Post-Probable Era\nSince the Questionable players are now a mix of players who were previously both “Questionable” and “Probable” a natural question is: can we predict which “Questionable” players in 2016 are going to play (we’ll ignore the question of whether they’ll play well, for now)? Let’s check a few different predictors: injury type, practice status, and the player’s team.\n\nInjury Type:\n\n\n\n\n\nMost injuries seem to be clustered right around the overall average of 75%, marked with a red line in the above chart (the mid-season average was 73%). Players with back injuries (85% active) and concussions (82% active) were the most likely to play. Concussions (which were also above-average in the mid-season analysis) in particular makes sense to me since the return-to-play process portion of the NFL’s concussion protocol, while it has no set timeline, is often hard to complete in 5 days but easier to complete in 7, leaving a lot of players as “Questionable” on the game status report but ready to suit up on game day.\nBack injuries were basically average in our mid-season analysis, but they’re substantially higher now; quadriceps/thigh injuries followed a reverse pattern. I’m not sure what to make of either of these, but if any trainers or physical therapists or physicians want to weigh in in the comments, please do!\nOn the other end, players with groin injuries (70% active) were somewhat below average both at mid-season and now. I’m not sure I have an explanation for that but, again, I would value any input trainers or medical folks can provide down in the comments!\nI’ve also included error bars, which represent 95% confidence intervals. The intervals mostly overlap and all but back injuries include the overall average, so it’s possible there are no true differences among injuries and all we’re seeing is random noise. But if I had to guess, I think we’re seeing a real higher active proportion among concussions and maybe back injuries (though that’s tempered by the fact that they were average at mid-season). I’m not so sure about groin injuries being truly lower, either.\n\n\nPractice Status:\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails on the trajectories are available here. In a nutshell: I stratified by the player’s final practice report status (Full/FP, Limited/LP, or none/DNP) before their game each week and the trajectory (down/flat/up) their statuses followed throughout the week.\nOverall, if your final practice status was FP/LP/DNP, you played 83/76/47% of the time (the DNP figure is a bit higher than it was at mid-season). We often hear fantasy experts saying they’re concerned if a player doesn’t practice late in the week; this data bears that out, but it’s also not a death sentence.\nAs far as the trajectories go there’s less, but still some, variation. Overall, Down/Flat/Up trajectories meant you played 72/70/82% of the time. So if you’re trending up (as I’ve defined it) you’re more likely to play, whereas flat and down trajectories are similar at a bit below the overall average.\nWhen we stratify by both, we see that among player-weeks with full participation in their last practice, those who were trending up (86% active) were somewhat more likely to play than those who stayed flat (80%), though this difference is much smaller than it was at mid-season.\nAmong players with limited participation at their last practice report, there was virtually no variation by trajectory; all groups were 76-77% likely to play.\nAmong players who did not participate in their final practice, those who had declined from mid-week actually had a decent chance to still play: 61%. That’s kind of surprising to me – it may be semi-injured guys just being given Friday off? Meanwhile, if a guy doesn’t practice all week his chances of playing are pretty low at 32%. Honestly, that’s still higher than I was expecting!\nExcept as noted above, these figures are largely in line with our mid-season analysis.\n\n\nTeam:\nTeams have historically exhibited quite a bit of variation in what proportion of their “Questionable” players suit up on Sunday. Did this continue in 2016?\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall you see quite a bit of variation by team – from Cincinnati with 93% of questionable players suiting up to Tennessee with just 35%. This is about the same range we saw in the mid-season analysis, as well.\nYou see a pretty even distribution of proportions across teams – they follow a gradation rather than being in “high” or “low” clusters. This suggests to me teams have settled on a natural range of definitions for what constitutes a “Questionable” player – this is to be expected when the official League definition of “Questionable” is the vague “uncertain that the player will play.”\nNotably, this is about the same pattern of Questionable usage we saw before Probable was eliminated, so this isn’t really a new phenomenon of confusion. Indeed, some teams at least seem to have stumbled onto a definition they like and stuck with it, particularly at the low end: the bottom 3 teams in questionable active percentage in 2016 (Titans, Seahawks, and Jaguars) were 1st, 3rd, and 9th lowest in 2015, as well (they were 5th, 9th, and 11th lowest in 2014). These teams could be thought of as resistant to reporting minor injuries as “Questionable,” upping the chance that someone who is listed as such won’t play.\nThe Steelers are an example of a team that seems especially tight with listing Questionable players: in 2016 they had the 8th lowest in percentage and listed the second fewest players as Questionable. In 2015 and 2014 they listed the 3rd fewest and fewest, respectively; their active percentage was lowest in both those years, too. So if you’ve got a Questionable Steeler in your fantasy lineup, check their status carefully.\nAs a sidenote, New England – where Bill Belichick has a reputation for…strategic use of the injury report – did list a league-high 113 player-weeks as Questionable in 2016. However, they have played at a near-average clip, suiting up 73% of the time. I’m a Dolphins fan, and even I have to admit that doesn’t support the shady Belichick narrative."

    "text": "Conclusions\nOur numbers were largely in line with what we saw through the first 8 weeks of the season, though our larger sample size reduces some of the uncertainty we had at mid-season.\nOverall, a little over a third of players previously marked as Probable appear to now be Questionable, with the remainder falling off the injury report. Questionable players are more likely to play now than they were in the past: the proportion has risen from the low-to-mid-60s to around 75% (which was, interestingly, always the stated proportion of Probables who should have played).\nAs far as which Questionables will suit up, the type of injury doesn’t help a whole lot. Certain patterns of practicing and not practicing during the week can certainly identify high- and low-risk players. Finally, teams exhibit a lot of variation in the severity of injuries that lead them to mark a player as Questionable, a fact that could be leveraged to make better predictions about which players will hit the field on game day (with the major limitation that we’re not predicting anything about how well they’ll perform if/when they get off the sideline)."

    "text": "In my last post I began looking at the effects of removing “Probable” from the game status portion of the NFL Injury Report this year. This left only three categories for players to fall into: “Questionable,” “Doubtful,” and “Out”.\n“Out,” like it always did, means the player is certain to not play. Per our data, “Doubtful” continues to mean essentially the same thing.\n“Questionable” is where things get interesting. According to my analysis, about 1/3 of players who would have previously been marked “Probable” in earlier years are now marked “Questionable,” while the other 2/3 simply aren’t listed (i.e. they’re considered “not injured”). This has altered what “Questionable” means in terms of how likely a player is to suit up on game day – in previous years 60-65% played in the next game, but so far in 2016 it’s 73%!\nThat means the “Questionable” players – already a hard-to-predict group – got even more heterogeneous. But can we look a little deeper and try and identify those more or less likely to suit up for their next game? I’m going to stratify by team, injury type, and practice status to try and find out!"

    "text": "Practice Status\nAs I outlined in the previous post, teams issue 3 (only 2 if they play on Thursday) “practice reports” during the week that tell us if injured players had “Full Participation” (FP), “Limited Particiation” (LP), or that they “Did Not Participate” (DNP). If a player only had 1 or 2 of the 3 practice statuses (for example, if a guy first strains his hamstring in a Thursday practice) we would expect for a non-Thursday game, we assumed the other practices were “Full Participation.”\nI wanted to stratify these statuses in a couple ways:\n\nLast practice status before a game (typically Friday for a Sunday game)\nPractice status trajectory. This could be “Flat,” “Up,” or “Down.”\n“Up” means a player improved between any earlier practice and his final practice. “Down” means a player’s final practice status was lower than all previous practice statuses. All others were “Flat.” Here are a couple examples, with practice statuses listed from Wednesday to Friday for a Sunday game:\nLP LP LP = Flat\nDNP FP FP = Up\nDNP FP LP = Up\nLP DNP FP = Up\nFP FP LP = Down\nLP FP DNP = Down\nYou can certainly debate the merits of this categorization scheme, but I think it correctly captures most cases and is good enough for our purposes.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the data!\n\n\n\n\n\nHeeeeeyyyyy, now we’re cookin’! Overall, if your final practice status was FP/LP/DNP, you played 87/74/39% of the time. We often hear fantasy experts saying they’re concerned if a player doesn’t practice late in the week; this data bears that out, but it’s also not a death sentence.\nAs far as the trajectories go there’s a bit less variation. Overall, Down/Flat/Up trajectories meant you played 70/68/82% of the time. So if you’re trending up (as I’ve defined it) you’re more likely to play, whereas flat and down trajectories are similar at a bit below the overall average.\nWhen we stratify by both, we see that among player-weeks with full participation in their last practice, those who were trending up (93% active) were way more likely to play than those who stayed flat (76%). That’s kind of surprising since players who were able to practice fully the whole week despite their injury seem like they should be good to go on Sunday, but the data shows that those whose practice status indicates a recovery over the course of the week are even more likely to suit up.\nAmong players with limited participation at their last practice report, there wasn’t a whole lot of variation by trajectory. Player-weeks with down/flat/up trajectories played 74/75/70% of the time. So it looks like if a player is limited at practice late in the week, they’re basically of average likelihood to play.\nAmong players who did not participate in their final practice, those who had declined from mid-week actually had a decent chance to still play: 66%. That’s kind of surprising to me – it may be semi-injured guys just being given Friday off? Meanwhile, if a guy doesn’t practice all week his chances of playing are pretty low at 26%. Honestly, that’s still higher than I was expecting!"

    "title": "Article Review: Pitching a Complete Game and DL Risk",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wanted to start by discussing an article that came out a couple months ago in the Orthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine entitled “Relationship Between Pitching a Complete Game and Spending Time on the Disabled List for Major League Baseball Pitchers.”\ntl;dr: This article makes a claim that is completely unsupported by its analysis. Please don’t use it. Read on below for a deeper dive into (some of) the big reasons why.\nBefore I get into that, though, I just want to say that I’m only writing about this article in particular because it happened to slide across my Twitter timeline on a morning when I had some spare time and motivation to write about it. I do think the errors here are particularly egregious, but the same types of mistakes are extremely common in a lot of sports injury papers. I hate to feel like I’m singling out just one research group, so please understand that my criticisms will likely apply to a lot of what you read, not just these folks.\nOK, onward!\nResearch Question: The authors sought to “to determine the relationship between pitching a CG and time on the DL”. Reading into this a bit, they suspect that pitching a complete game puts greater stress on/creates more fatigue for pitchers, leaving them at higher risk for future injury.\nThere’s been a lot of research on how many and what kinds of pitches can be “safely” thrown, but a “complete game” (CG) is an odd proxy marker to use. Why would a CG in and of itself be dangerous? Wouldn’t the number of pitches or some measure of cumulative stress be better?\nBut let’s set that aside and say this is a fine question to investigate. The study is still not good.\nConclusions: In the abstract (which is all most people read and what most news reports on articles will be based off of), the authors focus on one main result: “Overall, 74% of pitchers who threw a CG spent time on the DL, as compared with 20% of [matched] controls.”\nHoly smokes, Batman! This statement implies that pitchers who throw a CG are nearly 4 times as likely to end up on the DL as matched controls (otherwise similar pitchers who did not toss a CG). That’s a huge effect…if true. Unfortunately, nothing in their paper supports this conclusion. At all.\nLet’s dig in to the meat of the paper (Methods and Results) and see where these numbers came from.\nThe problems:\n\nWho was included in the study? This is rather hard to dig out of the Methods (it shouldn’t be), but as near as I can tell there were 1,016 pitcher-seasons included in the study. Of these, 501 were for 246 individual pitchers who threw a CG at some point from 2010-2016 (which I’ll term the “exposed” group of pitcher-seasons) and then, presumably, 515 from [an unknown number of] pitchers who did not throw a CG at any point from 2010-2016 (which the authors term “controls” but I’ll term “unexposed”). This is already a weird breakdown that leaves several elementary questions unaddressed, among them:\n-Were only starters included in the non-CG group?\n-How many non-CG pitchers were used?\n“74% of pitchers who threw a CG spent time on the DL”: Where does this come from? Of the 501 pitcher-seasons from pitchers who pitched a CG at some point from 2010-16, 370 (74%) included time on the DL. This is very different from the statement provided in the abstract (and also, frankly, seems very high, but I’m not going to fact-check this right now).\nThe matched controls: The authors state they created a comparison group of pitchers who never threw a CG in their careers and matched them to pitchers who did and ended up on the DL in the same year they threw a CG (which they term the “CG/DL group”). Hold that thought. We are never told how many pitchers are in either group – just how many pitcher-seasons are in the CG/DL group (115).These pitchers were matched on age (cool), “year” (presumably the years they pitched, though this is never stated), and…IP during the “index season” (for the CG/DL pitchers, the year [or years? never stated] they threw a CG and went on the DL).\nSo. You’re selecting control pitchers who threw a comparable number of innings without getting a complete game. Which means they made up the innings somewhere else. Where’s the most likely place to make up that ground? How about not going on the DL?\nThis is selecting on the dependent variable. You’re choosing a control group that was by definition less likely to be hurt and then trying to turn around and use that as evidence that CGs are risky. Bad.\nThey also stated that they were able to create a matched control group for the CG/DL pitchers, but not for any pitcher who threw a CG because they couldn’t find appropriate matches. This is further evidence for selecting on the dependent variable: they could only find matches on IP for CG pitchers who also went on the DL. Without a DL trip, there were no matches.\nOh, and the matching on the IP wasn’t even good! Controls pitched on average 38 fewer innings per year (136 vs. 174). So why even claim you matched? You didn’t do so successfully, anyway.\n“Overall, 74% of pitchers who threw a CG spent time on the DL, as compared with 20% of [matched] controls”: This statement, which is repeated over and over as the article’s primary conclusions, is a false comparison totally unsupported by the article’s analysis and text. First off, the 20% figure is for a single season only (the “index season” described above). In fact 50%, not 20%, of controls spent time on the DL at some point during the study period.\nAlright, so the 74% vs. 20% is already bust-o. But we’re not done yet.\nThe authors also never matched their controls to the full CG group. They matched them to the CG/DL group, where by definition 100% of the pitcher-seasons involved time on the DL. This is textbook selection on the dependent variable and makes any comparison with the CG/DL group worthless. 100% vs. 20% or 50% means nothing here.\nBut let’s assume the controls are somehow a decent comparison for the full group of CG pitchers. We’re told that at some point throughout the study period 50% of control pitchers spent time on the DL. What is that corresponding figure for the CG pitchers? Well, conveniently, we’re never given it. We’re only told 74% of pitcher-seasons involved time on the DL.\nSo the authors are trying to compare the % of control pitchers who spent time on the DL in a single season with the % of CG pitcher-seasons over 7 years involving time on the DL. And we don’t have the % of pitcher-seasons for the controls or the % of pitchers for the CG group. Oh, and the two groups aren’t actually matched and we have no idea whether they’re comparable (in fact, we have evidence from the IP figures that they are not). Am I missing anything?\n\nSummary: This paper is a mess. It’s unclear, incomplete, lacks basic details, makes invalid comparisons left and right, and appears to repeatedly select on the dependent variable. If I had reviewed this paper I would have never recommended it be published in its current state. I urge you to disregard its findings. It provides zero evidence for CGs in and of themselves being dangerous. I am genuinely alarmed this was published in OJSM."

    "text": "This week the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) published the results of a randomized trial of headgear to reduce concussions in soccer players.\nHere’s an example of the type of headgear being investigated, in case you’re curious:\nBefore I jump in to my criticisms, I do want to commend the authors for running a randomized trial on an important question. Preventing concussions is a matter of physics. It’s all about dissipating collision forces so less of it transmits to your skull and shakes your brain inside of it. Helmets in sports like football were designed for a totally different engineering task: preventing skull fractures, which they’re great at. And as big of a concern as concussions have become, we only know of one surefire way to prevent them: stop collisions that shake people’s heads. All that is to say rigorous studies on new technologies that claim to protect the brains of sports participants from concussions are extremely important.\nI also want to be upfront about what I expected this study to show, because scientists almost always approach a topic with some preconceived notions; we need to acknowledge and embrace that. I expected headgear to have virtually no effect on concussions.\nAnd lo and behold, the randomized trial showed just that! So why am I writing this critical post?\nWell, it’s dumb luck that I looked at this study more closely even though it confirmed what I expected to see. Someone tweeted out the main results table from the study and something didn’t look right – in fact, something was mathematically impossible (SEE Irregularity #2 below). That led me to read the whole paper, and there are some substantial irregularities in the analysis I want to call everyone’s attention to.\nThe below points aren’t my only concerns with the study, but they’re the biggest ones to which I want to call everyone’s attention."

Then the schools’ athletic trainers (ATs) recorded for every athlete in every practice and game (each one representing one athlete-exposure (AE)) three things: whether each student participated, whether each student wore headgear, and what type of headgear they wore (if any).\nThe ATs also reported all injuries sustained during the study. ATs were left to evaluate and determine what qualified as a concussion, albeit it with guidance from the National Athletic Trainers’ Association Position Statement on the topic.\nWith this in mind, let’s dig in to some strange things about the study."

It’s virtually unheard of in this kind of research.\nI’m only half-joking when I say if I randomized a group of study subjects to get a crisp $100 bill dropped into their laps every morning, with no effort on their part and no strings attached, I wouldn’t expect 99.5% adherence.\nQuality control in a study this size is no joke.

The details of why are not for this post, though.\nnd Concussions This week the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) published the results of a randomized trial of headgear to reduce concussions in soccer players.\nHere’s an example of the type of headgear being investigated, in case you’re curious:\nheadguard_newlogo_1024x1024 One of five different types of headgear tested in the study. Before I jump in to my criticisms, I do want to commend the authors for running a randomized trial on an important question. Preventing concussions is a matter of physics. It’s all about dissipating collision forces so less of it transmits to your skull and shakes your brain inside of it. Helmets in sports like football were designed for a totally different engineering task: preventing skull fractures, which they’re great at. And as big of a concern as concussions have become, we only know of one surefire way to prevent them: stop collisions that shake people’s heads. All that is to say rigorous studies on new technologies that claim to protect the brains of sports participants from concussions are extremely important.\nI also want to be upfront about what I expected this study to show, because scientists almost always approach a topic with some preconceived notions; we need to acknowledge and embrace that. I expected headgear to have virtually no effect on concussions.\nAnd lo and behold, the randomized trial showed just that! So why am I writing this critical post?\nWell, it’s dumb luck that I looked at this study more closely even though it confirmed what I expected to see. Someone tweeted out the main results table from the study and something didn’t look right – in fact, something was mathematically impossible (SEE Irregularity #2 below). That led me to read the whole paper, and there are some substantial irregularities in the analysis I want to call everyone’s attention to.\nThe below points aren’t my only concerns with the study, but they’re the biggest ones to which I want to call everyone’s attention."

Then the schools’ athletic trainers (ATs) recorded for every athlete in every practice and game (each one representing one athlete-exposure (AE)) three things: whether each student participated, whether each student wore headgear, and what type of headgear they wore (if any).\nThe ATs also reported all injuries sustained during the study. ATs were left to evaluate and determine what qualified as a concussion, albeit it with guidance from the National Athletic Trainers’ Association Position Statement on the topic.\nWith this in mind, let’s dig in to some strange things about the study."

If they didn’t get concussed, they put them in the group where they spent the majority of their time, thus misclassifying up to 49% of any given student’s AEs. If they did get concussed, they put them…in the group they were in when they got concussed. This is very, very bad. Here’s why:\n\nJimmy dutifully wears his headgear on Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday he forgets it at home and plays without it. He gets a concussion. He’s out Thursday and Friday. He is classified in the no headgear group even if he remembers and wears his headgear every day the rest of the season. That week the no headgear group gets credited for 1 concussion in 3 days.\nHis sister, Jenny, also wears her headgear Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday she forgets it at home with Jimmy’s. She plays without it but is fine. She plays on Thursday and Friday with her headgear. The headgear group now gets credited with 5 days and 0 concussions.\n\nHuh? That doesn’t make any sense.\nWhat should have happened is the head gear group should have been credited with 6 AEs (4 from Jenny, 2 from Jimmy) and 0 concussions, while the no head gear group should have been credited with 2 AE (1 from Jenny, 1 from Jimmy) and 1 concussion. Instead, head gear gets credited with 5 AEs and 0 concussions, while the no head gear group gets credited with 3 AEs and 1 concussion.\nThis difference is a bias – it makes our results incorrect. With Jimmy and Jenny the result is to bias our results to make head gear look less protective as it gets one fewer safe day than it should’ve been credited with. In the actual article the direction of this bias is unpredictable because we don’t know exactly which students were non-adherent when – though the study authors say they do.\nThe authors need to re-do the as-treated analysis assigning each athlete-exposure, rather than each student, to whether they wore head gear each day or not. This should give us results very similar to the intention-to-treat analysis since only 0.47% of AEs were non-adherent and thus would be re-classified in the as-treated analysis.\nExcept it won’t.\nBecause…"

We have to say “at least” because there were 68 concussions charged to the headgear group in the intention-to-treat analysis and 75 in the as-treated analysis, but some concussions could’ve also switched the other way.\nDespite a net change of 7 (out of 130) concussions between groups, there was only a net change of 1 (out of 3,050) player-seasons. That is also strange, but set it aside for now.\nTaken together, these suggest that there were far more instances of the headgear group not wearing their headgear than the no-headgear students donning their own independently. That makes a lot of sense, at least.\nGetting back to the net change in concussions: this means there were at least 7 concussions in the 711 non-adherent AEs, most of which seem to be headgear students neglecting to wear theirs. This is a rate of 7/711 = 9.85 per 1,000 AEs.\nThis leaves 123 concussions in the remaining 150,466 AEs where students adhered to their assigned treatment, for a rate of 0.82 per 1,000 AEs.\nThis means the rate of concussions was 12 times higher in non-adherent than adherent AEs.

    "title": "New Sports Performance Technologies: The 4 Key Questions Teams Need to Ask",
    "section": "",
    "text": "So here are the four simple but broad questions that I ask with any new technology, in the order in which I ask them. I’ll use a single example of a hypothetical portable tool that measures forces acting on the shoulder joint of baseball pitchers to illustrate my four questions.\n\n“Does this technology measure anything?” This can be roughly mapped to the concept of reliability in psychometrics. Is your new tool consistently measuring something or just giving you noise? Ways to check this include repeated testing on the same player (e.g. for neurocognitive tools where the player’s underlying cognitive skills shouldn’t change massively day-to-day) or having multiple players run the same drill while checking for consistent results (e.g. a wearable that purports to measure steps, jumps, or other movements).\n\nIf we have a device that purports to measure shoulder force, we can first check if it gives reliable readings for a series of fastballs of similar velocities from the same pitcher. If the answer is YES, then you can a*sk…\n\n“Does this technology measure what you hope it’s measuring and/or what it purports to measure?” This roughly corresponds to statistical validity. If you have a tool measuring reaction time or trajectory tracking, how can you make sure it’s measuring that and not something else? Can you check recorded jump heights from accelerometers against external height measures? Does an “energy expended” measure exhibit within-player correlation with ratings of perceived exertion (RPE)?\n\nSticking with our hypothetical shoulder tool, we could ask if its data correlates well with a gold standard measurement of shoulder forces such as a full biomechanical analysis. If the answer is YES…\n\n“Can what this technology measures translate potentially to on-field value (i.e. wins)?” This is probably the most complex question and can require a lot of time and patience to properly test. Given the timeframe in which teams operate it may not be possible to get a clear answer to this question, but we should still do our best. What it boils down to is this: Devices give you data, but getting insights from this data is a totally separate question. Getting actionable insights is even harder. Making sure those actionable insights translate to more winning is harder still.\n\nSay our new portable force measurement tool reliably and correctly measures the forces acting on a pitcher’s shoulder joint. That’s great. Now what can that information do for us? Could we potentially alter a pitcher’s mechanics to make him less injury prone? Can we catch small biomechanical changes to identify small health issues before they turn into big ones? Can we watch the forces build up in real time to better predict pitcher fatigue and on-field effectiveness, which might change our bullpen usage? If the answer is YES to at least something…\n\n“Is your organization positioned to translate this potential into wins?” This is arguably the most important question and probably where I’ve seen teams make the most mistakes. Investing in a technology is one thing, but having the internal champions to use the technology regularly and the administrative and player buy-in to translate your insights to actual on-field improvements is critical. You need a plan for how you’re going to deploy any new tool which includes: who’s going to be using it? Who’s going to be responsible for its regular and continued use? How will you translate its data into communicable and actionable insights? Is your organization going to be willing to use these insights?\n\nSticking with our shoulder tool, let’s say the tool, remarkably, is reliable and accurate. Let’s say even more remarkably you’ve managed to develop a plan to use insights from the data to actually make your team win more. Unfortunately, that device still has no value for you if everyone involved in its success – in our case maybe the manager, pitching coach, pitchers, trainers, S&C staff, and analytics team – isn’t committed to making it happen.\n\n\n\nSports teams buying new technologies with no internal champion or usage plan. Source.\n\n\nThese questions are not specific to the shoulder tool that I outlined. You can ask them of any sports performance technology. For example, a GPS chip: 1. Does it accurately measure and calculate a guy’s straight-line speed? Does it correctly identify sprints, decelerations, and directional changes? 2. Can you use the pre-calculated measures it spits out or the raw data underlying them to calculate a relevant workload or skill metric in your sport? 3. Can those metrics translate to on-field success? For example, can workload be modified to improve fitness and minimize fatigue and injuries? Or can you better identify players with the instincts to be where they need to be on the field above and beyond traditional scouting? 4. Will your organization actually do that?\nAnother example, cognitive testing tool: 1. Does it yield similar scores day after day in the same guy, or is it so sensitive to a hangover or how much sleep a guy got you can’t trust it? 2. If it purports to measure, say, reaction time, does it measure that in a way that’s relevant for your sport? 3. Could you use it to make decisions about which guys to draft or sign, or could you identify a weakness and design drills to improve a player’s skills? 4. Will you?\nAnd if you ever need any help asking or answering these questions, I’m always happy to talk."

    "text": "The Study\nIt’s always good to start analyzing a study1 by figuring out just what question the researchers were trying to answer. In their own words, the study’s purpose was “To compare the suicide mortality of a cohort of NFL players to what would be expected in the general population of the United States.” Notice their stated purpose was NOT to determine whether playing in the NFL causes or prevents suicides. This is a responsible omission because their study can’t answer that question.\nThey took a cohort of 3,439 retired NFL players who played 5 or more seasons from 1959-1988 using an NFL pension fund database. They watched these players through 2013 and counted 12 suicides.\nThey then asked how many suicides would we have expected among a sample of 3,439 people chosen from among all U.S. adult males, followed over the same time period, and having similar ages and races as these NFL retirees. Using national mortality rates and cause-of-death data2, the researchers estimated they would have seen 25.3 suicides in this group.\n12/25.3 = 0.47, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) reported in the study. This corresponds to a 53% lower suicide rate in the NFL players versus all U.S. men of similar ages and races. In epidemiology we refer to this whole process as indirect standardization.3 Got it? Cool.\nNow, it’s really important to understand what this SMR means and, even more importantly, what it DOESN’T mean. Specifically, in the context of this study this is NOT strong evidence for football preventing suicides. (To their great credit the authors do not overstate their conclusions in their paper. To my great surprise, neither did the majority of media outlets reporting on the study.) To understand why the study doesn’t allow us to draw this conclusion, let’s appeal to the great scientist Keanu Reeves."

In this study our “outcome” is suicide rate and “playing NFL football for 5+ years”5 is our “exposure” of interest (the thing whose effect on suicides we want to measure).\nOK, so also say you had no financial, time, or even reality-based limitations on what you could do. How would you study this question? Go ahead, take a minute. I’ll wait.\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nThe time machine from Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure has a surprising amount to teach us about real science.\n\n\nOK, want my answer? Well you’re getting it anyway. I’d take the 3,439 retired NFL players from the pension database, watch them for suicides through 2013, then…\n…hop in a time machine, go back to when each of them was born, and not change anything except to stop them from playing in the NFL. This would then become our unexposed group. I would then travel back to 2013 and check to see how many of them committed suicide under these new, no-NFL conditions.\n\n\n\nGaro Yepremian just FALLING ON THE GOD BLESSED FOOTBALL IN SUPER BOWL VII is a perfect example of a counterfactual.\n\n\nThis whole time-traveling scenario is something epidemiologists call a counterfactual. This is simply a scenario we might have liked to observe but didn’t. Here, I’ll let The Big Bang Theory explain. It’s useful when we’re thinking about how to measure the causal effect of an exposure, such as whether playing in the NFL raises or lowers suicide rates.\nThis study, setting aside all concerns about feasibility, would let us isolate the effect of “playing NFL football for 5+ years” (versus not playing in the NFL) on suicide rates. If we see more than 12 suicides in the unexposed group that was stopped from playing in the NFL, then playing NFL football for 5+ years prevents suicides; fewer than 12 suicides would suggest the opposite."

Surely the exact same men who were only stopped from playing in the NFL stand in well for the actual players from the pension database in every way except playing in the NFL for 5+ years, right? If this is the case, then we can be certain that any differences in suicides we observe were because of playing in the NFL for 5+ years!"

    "text": "Confounding in the NIOSH Study\nIf your exposed and unexposed groups are not exchangeable, however, you have what scientists call confounding. Simply put, this means the effect of one thing is mixed up with the effect of another thing(s).\nNFL players are vastly different from the general U.S. male population in any number of ways. Although the NIOSH study made sure these general males were the same ages and races as the NFL players, the general males may be, for example, less wealthy on average. They’re certainly in much worse shape than these elite athletes (well, besides the arthritis and chronic pain in NFL retirees, maybe). They probably smoke more and have very different health habits and behavioral patterns than NFL players. For clear evidence of this, look no further than Table 1 in the paper: while suicide rates were 53% lower, overall death rates were also 40% lower in NFL retirees than would have been expected in the general population. Cancer deaths were 41% lower and cardiovascular deaths 25% lower; these all suggest better baseline health for the elite athletes. Assaults and homicides were a whopping 83% lower than expected, suggesting possible differences in socioeconomic status. Other data from this same cohort, interestingly, do show much higher death rates for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, among NFL retirees.\nThe point is any of these could be associated both with playing in the NFL and suicide. If these variables are also not the result of playing NFL football (perhaps income is, but lifelong healthy habits may not be), they aren’t something whose effects we want to measure. In the NIOSH study, the effects of these “extraneous” variables cannot be teased out from those of actually playing on a professional football team, severely limiting our ability to draw conclusions about professional football’s effects on suicide rates.6"

    "text": "Yeah but, Like, What is “Playing in the NFL” Anyway, Man?\n\n\n\nPlaying in the NFL may be a double-edged swords with regards to suicide risk. In some ways it could worse, and in other ways prevent, suicides. That makes its effects hard to study.\n\n\nBut it’s not as simple as all that. One important thing we waved our hands at above is the exact definition of our exposure (the thing whose effect on suicide rates we want to estimate). We can say it’s “playing in the NFL for 5+ years,” but what exactly does that entail? It includes a lot of bangs to the head, sure, but it also (at least today, less so from 1959-1988) includes a nice payday. These could have contradictory effects on suicide rates, but if we just compare a group of long-term NFL players with men who didn’t play football we can’t tease these out: any difference we see could be due to brain disease from football-related head trauma, or having a few hundred thousand dollars in the bank, or a combination of both.\nThink about it like this: if you went back in time to alter something about the NFL retirees from the NIOSH study, whatever thing(s) you change are responsible for the differences you observe. If stopping someone from playing in the NFL prevents head trauma but also cuts their paycheck, you’re going to see the effects of both of those in 2013.\nIf what we really wanted to know was whether the head trauma associated with playing in the NFL for 5+ years influenced suicide risk, perhaps we could compare NFL retirees to other professional athletes, such as MLB or NBA retirees, who may look similar to (that is, are exchangeable with) NFL players on many health and socioeconomic factors but just haven’t had those hits to the head.7\nOf course, maybe we want to estimate the NFL’s total effect on suicide risk, instead. Then income, and perhaps some other health factors influenced by playing professional football, would be intermediate “steps” on the path between playing in the NFL and suicide. Anything that is a result of playing in the NFL cannot, in this case, be a confounder, because it’s part of the effect we said we wanted to measure – and maybe comparing NFL retirees to a general population group is more valid.\nSo the lesson here is always be very careful and explicit when defining the thing whose effects you want to measure, because even something as seemingly clear as “playing in the NFL for 5+ years” is, upon closer inspection, actually pretty muddy."

    "text": "So Is the NIOSH Study Worthless?\nNot at all! It did exactly what it set out to do: it compared suicide rates in the NFL to a hypothetical cohort of all U.S. males with similar ages and races. This is a valuable data point that suggests maybe we’re biased by high-profile news reports of famous athletes killing themselves. It just simply can’t tell us much, in my mind, about the effect of professional football on suicide rates. Better but still realistic studies might entail comparing NFL retirees to a more similar group, such as other elite professional retired athletes, or statistically adjusting for some of the confounders I outlined above.\nSuch a study was actually done for college athletes; it found that while NCAA athletes as a whole had much lower suicide rates than college students in general, NCAA football players had more than twice the suicide rate of other male college athletes. Though college football players are unpaid so income can’t be the reason, this data speaks strongly to the “double-edged sword” hypothesis above: football might have a bad effect on suicide rates, but the benefits of being an athlete overall may outweigh those, resulting in a net lower rate.\nWhether playing football is good or bad for suicides, then, depends on how exactly you want to define “playing football.”"
